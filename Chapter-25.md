# Chapter 25: Identification

The Coast Guard station in Boothbay Harbor smelled like diesel fuel, salt, and burnt coffee. Standard government building—linoleum floors, fluorescent lights, metal desks, nautical charts on walls. Maritime bureaucracy made orderly through forms and regulations.

Claire gave her statement to a young petty officer with a typewriter. Question, answer, question, answer. Purpose of visit? Duration? First encounter with individual? Describe sabotage. Describe confrontation.

She answered mechanically, exhausted. Beside her, Kate gave a parallel statement. Down the hall, Brian and Allison did the same. Converting nightmare to paperwork.

In another room, the prisoner was being processed.

The petty officer asked standard questions: Name? No answer. Date of birth? No answer. Address? Current employment? Social security number? Next of kin?

Nothing. Just silence and that distant stare, eyes focused on something beyond the fluorescent-lit room.

Finally, he spoke. Two words.

"The keeper."

"That's not a name, sir. I need your legal name for the report."

"The keeper. I'm the keeper. That's all I am. That's all I've ever been."

The petty officer looked to the supervising officer—a grizzled chief petty officer who'd been processing Coast Guard paperwork since before this prisoner was born. The chief shrugged. They'd dealt with uncooperative detainees before.

"Mark him as unidentified pending investigation. We'll get fingerprints, maybe match something in the system."

In the hallway, Claire finished her statement and found the Coast Guard captain who'd rescued them—Captain William Morrison, thirty-two years of service, approaching retirement, still solid as lighthouse stone. He was reviewing the preliminary reports, frown deepening.

"Dr. Ashford. Your statement mentions the individual claims to be Silas Grant."

"That's correct. He identified himself by that name. We found historical records suggesting Silas Grant was the last official lighthouse keeper at Whitmore Point, fired in 1966."

Morrison's frown deepened. "Silas Grant drowned in 1967."

"Yes. That's what the records say. But he claims—"

"I know what he claims. I need to see him."

Morrison's tone had changed. Something beyond professional curiosity. Something personal. Claire followed him to the processing room.

The prisoner sat handcuffed to a metal chair, still wearing his rotting layers despite offers of dry clothes, still staring at nothing, still whispering fragments to the absent lighthouse. Morrison stood in the doorway, examining him from ten feet away.

The color drained from the captain's face.

"Jesus Christ," he breathed.

"Sir?" The processing officer looked concerned.

Morrison stepped closer, studying the prisoner's face with the intensity of someone confronting an impossibility. The gaunt features, the weathered skin, the pale blue eyes, the white hair and beard. Every detail scrutinized, compared to memory fifteen years old.

"That's Silas Grant's face." Morrison's voice was hollow. "Exactly. I remember it."

"Sir, Silas Grant died in—"

"November 1967. I know. I was there." Morrison turned to face Claire and the assembled officers. "I was twenty-six years old, petty officer third class, stationed at this base. Storm night, call came in about a capsized boat off Whitmore Point. We went out, found the wreckage, recovered a body three days later when the weather cleared."

He turned back to the prisoner, who'd finally focused on him, recognition dawning.

"You pulled me from the water," the prisoner said quietly. "You and three others. I was dead on the rocks. You tried to revive me but I was gone. I remember your face. Young. Frightened."

Morrison's hands trembled. "I've seen dozens of drowned men since. But you were my first. Silas Grant, age sixty-one. We identified you by Navy tattoos, dental records. I attended your funeral. Watched them lower your coffin."

"Fifty-three people attended," the prisoner said. "Frank Garrison gave the eulogy. Said I was the best keeper Whitmore Point ever had."

Morrison backed away, hand over his mouth, looking like he might be sick. "This isn't possible. You're dead. You've been dead for fourteen years. I saw your body. I touched it. You were dead."

"I was," the prisoner agreed. "I am. I'm death that came back because the light needed keeping. I told you this. I told all of you. But you don't listen. The living never listen to the dead."

Morrison left the room fast, needed air. Claire found him in the hallway, breathing hard.

"That's Silas Grant." Morrison's voice shook. "Same face, same build, same tattoos. Navy anchor on his left bicep, coordinates of Whitmore Point on his right forearm. Same man. Impossible, but true."

"Misidentification? Someone who looks—"

"No. I processed that body personally. Filled out the death certificate. Frank Garrison identified him—Silas had no family. Dental records matched. We buried Silas Grant in plot one-two-seven at Boothbay Harbor Cemetery. I watched."

He looked at Claire with haunted eyes. "And now he's in that room, alive, looking exactly the same as he did dead on those rocks. Not aged properly. Not changed. Just... back."

The chief petty officer emerged, practical and unshaken. "We need proper identification. Captain, should I call the Boothbay Harbor sheriff?"

"Yes. And tell them—" Morrison gathered himself, forced professional composure. "Tell them we have an unidentified individual claiming to be Silas Grant. They'll want to investigate."

"Should I mention that Silas Grant is deceased?"

"They'll figure that out fast enough."

Within the hour, Detective Raymond Cooper arrived from Boothbay Harbor PD—forty-eight years old, twenty-year veteran, seen everything small-town Maine could throw at him. He took statements from the team, reviewed Coast Guard records, examined the prisoner.

"So let me get this straight. This man says he's Silas Grant. Silas Grant drowned in 1967. But you're saying he looks like Silas Grant. And you're certain because you recovered the body."

Morrison nodded. "I'm certain."

"We can check dental records. Get a proper ID that way." Cooper made notes. "In the meantime, I want to speak to someone who knew Grant personally. Someone who can confirm or deny this identification."

"Frank Garrison," Morrison said immediately. "He was close with Silas. Fishing community, same waters. Frank attended the funeral, helped with arrangements. If anyone can identify him, it's Frank."

Cooper made the call. Twenty minutes later, Frank Garrison pulled up to the Coast Guard station in his battered pickup truck, reluctant and confused about why the police wanted him to identify a trespasser at Whitmore Point.

Claire watched through a one-way mirror as Frank was brought to the observation window, given a view into the processing room where the prisoner sat.

Frank looked. Went absolutely still. The coffee cup in his hand slipped from his fingers, hit the floor, shattered. Hot coffee splashed across linoleum, across his boots. He didn't notice.

"Jesus Christ." Same words Morrison had said, same tone of impossible recognition. "That's Silas. But we buried Silas in '67."

Cooper stepped forward. "You're certain?"

"I've known Silas Grant for thirty years. Fished the same waters, drank at the same bars, worked the same docks. That's him. Same face, same build, same scar on his left cheek from where he caught a winch cable in '63. That's Silas Grant."

"Silas Grant is deceased. You attended his funeral. You signed the death certificate as witness."

"I know what I signed." Frank couldn't look away from the window. "I identified the body. Navy tattoos, coordinates on his forearm, anchor on his bicep. I saw him dead. Drowned. Blue and swollen from three days in the water. I watched them lower the coffin. I threw dirt on the grave. And that—" He pointed at the prisoner. "—that's Silas Grant. Same man. Not older. Not different. Same."

Cooper gestured to an officer, who brought Frank the death certificate—yellowed with age, dated November 1967, bearing multiple signatures including Frank Garrison's bold scrawl.

"Is this your signature?"

"Yes."

"You identified this body as Silas Grant?"

"Yes. Because it was. Tattoos matched. Face matched. Dental records confirmed it later. That was Silas Grant dead on the coroner's table. And that—" Again he pointed. "—is Silas Grant alive in that room. I don't know how. I don't know why. But it's true. Both things are true."

Cooper looked at Morrison, at Claire, at the prisoner. Twenty years as a detective. Bar fights, domestic violence, drug overdoses, occasional murder. But this—beyond his reference frame.

"This is impossible," he said quietly.

Through the glass, the prisoner turned to face the mirror. Smiled that sad, gap-toothed smile.

Frank stumbled backward. "He knows I'm here. That's exactly what Silas would do. Always knew when he was being watched."

The prisoner spoke, voice muffled through glass but clear enough: "Hello, Frank. I told you I'd go back. I told you the light needed me. You didn't believe me, but here I am. Died for her. Came back for her. She always needs a keeper. She always will. And someone always answers."

Frank turned and walked out fast, needed air, needed distance, needed anything except looking at a dead friend who wasn't dead.

Cooper stood in the observation room, detective's mind trying to process impossible evidence. Man claims to be Silas Grant. Looks like Silas Grant. Two witnesses with personal knowledge confirm he is Silas Grant. But Silas Grant died fourteen years ago, funeral attended, body buried.

"I need the burial records," Cooper said finally. "And I need a forensic team at Boothbay Harbor Cemetery. If this man is Silas Grant, we need to know who the hell we buried in 1967."

Morrison nodded. "I'll authorize full cooperation."

Claire watched the prisoner through the glass. Silas Grant, keeper of Whitmore Point Light, alive and dead and something between. Smiling at observers, whispering to absent lighthouses, existing in defiance of rational explanation.

The bureaucratic machinery ground against impossibility and found no purchase. Forms required names, dates, rational progression. But what form existed for this? What box to check for a man who drowned, was buried, and came back because a lighthouse needed him?

Cooper turned to Claire. "Your team is free to go. We'll need you available for follow-up, but you're not under investigation. This is beyond anything I've seen, and I need time to figure out what the hell we're dealing with."

"Thank you." Claire felt only exhaustion. "What happens to him?"

"Psychiatric evaluation. Holding cell. Eventually we'll figure out who he is and what happened. But right now?" Cooper looked at the prisoner. "Right now I have no idea."

They left the Coast Guard station as afternoon faded to evening. Boothbay Harbor looked normal, mundane, real. Fishing boats in the harbor, tourists on the docks, restaurants preparing for dinner service. The world turning like it always had, unaware that impossible things existed three miles offshore.

Behind them, in a government building, bureaucrats grappled with a dead man who refused to stay dead.

And on Whitmore Point, a dark lighthouse stood in silence, waiting for someone to answer its call.

Always waiting.

Always calling.

Always.
