# Chapter 13: Tracking the Keeper

The storm cleared on the third day. Frank's boat left at dawn, the team watching Whitmore Point emerge from morning mist.

"Last chance to reconsider," Frank said. "Coast Guard comes tomorrow."

"We want to try talking to him first," Claire said.

They landed at the empty dock. Kate stayed with Frank—escape route if needed. Claire, Brian, and Allison stepped onto the island carrying minimal gear.

"Three hours," Frank called. "Trouble, I call the Coast Guard."

"Understood."

At the lighthouse base, their message remained, weighted with rocks. Someone had read it—the paper was unfolded, examined, replaced.

Next to it, a new carving:

*I UNDERSTAND*

*THANK YOU*

"He accepted it," Brian said.

The cottage was empty, undisturbed. Nothing taken or moved.

"Respecting our space now," Allison said. "Now that we're leaving."

Low tide. Perfect timing to explore the caves one last time.

They descended with flashlights. Familiar smell—salt, rot, stone. Same tally marks, evidence of habitation.

But the supply cache had been organized. Neatly arranged. As if he'd known they were coming and wanted to present his life in the best light.

They found him in the deepest chamber, sitting on a flat rock. Waiting. Calm, hands folded.

In the flashlight beam: gaunt face, white beard, weathered skin. Pale intense eyes. Age impossible to tell—malnutrition and exposure aged beyond counting.

Layers of salvaged clothing held with wire and rope. Boots wrapped in plastic. Fingerless wool gloves. Survival uniform.

"Hello," Claire said softly. "Thank you for meeting us. We're leaving today. Wanted to say goodbye."

"Not my island," the man said, voice rough. "Her island. The light's. I serve her."

"How long have you been keeping the light?" Brian asked.

"Always. Since the beginning. Until the end."

"Since 1967?"

"Since she needed me. They said machines could do it. They were wrong. The light needs a keeper. Someone who understands. Someone who listens."

"Listens to what?" Allison asked.

"The rocks. The water. The ships." He turned to them. "You can't hear them. But I do. Feel them. Every vessel, I feel its weight, its movement. I guide it safely past."

The delusion Brian had read about. Sensing ships, making the lighthouse function.

"The lighthouse works automatically," Claire said. "The equipment doesn't need a keeper."

"The equipment, no. But the true light needs a keeper. Machines have no understanding. The light is purpose. Vigilance. The promise that someone is watching, someone cares."

"And you are that someone," Brian said.

"I am. Fourteen winters. Storms that would break machinery. Isolation that would kill a lesser man. The light needs me. I need the light."

Allison sat on a rock, eye level with him. "What's your name?"

Long silence. Then: "I am the keeper. Names are for people with many roles. I have only one."

"Before you were the keeper. Did you have another name?"

Something flickered. "Before doesn't matter. Before ended when I drowned and came back. When the light gave me a second chance."

"November 1967. Tried to row back during a storm. The water took me. I felt the cold, the darkness, the acceptance of ending." His voice was distant, reciting from memory. "But the light called me back. The others showed me the way. I woke on the rocks, alive when I should have been dead. And I knew—I had been given a purpose. Keep the light. Protect the ships. Serve until I can serve no more."

Brian was writing frantically in his notebook. This matched Silas Grant's drowning exactly. November 1967, storm, rowing back to the island. But Silas had died. Frank had recovered the body.

"The others," Claire said. "Who are they?"

"The previous keepers. The ones who served before automation. They understand what it means to keep the light. They visit sometimes. Offer guidance. Show me the hidden passages, the safe spaces." The man gestured around the cave. "This place—they showed it to me. Taught me how to survive the tides, how to move unseen, how to endure."

Hallucinations, Claire thought. Loneliness and isolation manifesting as helpful ghosts. The mind creating company where none existed.

"Are you Silas Grant?" Brian asked directly.

The man looked at him for a long moment. "Silas Grant drowned in 1967. They buried him on the mainland. I am what came after. What the light needed. What the light created."

"That's not an answer," Brian said.

"It's the only answer I have." The man stood, moving toward the cave entrance. "The tide is turning. You should go before the water rises. The caves flood quickly."

They followed him up through the passages, emerging into daylight on the eastern shore. The man moved with absolute confidence, knowing every handhold, every safe step. This was his territory, learned over years of living underground and above.

On the surface, he walked to the lighthouse and placed his hand on the white stone. A gesture of affection, or ownership, or devotion. Claire couldn't tell which.

"Will you leave the island?" she asked. "When the Coast Guard comes tomorrow?"

"No." The man said it simply, without defiance or fear. "This is where I belong. This is my purpose. If they take me from here, I cease to be. Better to die as a keeper than live as nothing."

"They'll say you're mentally ill," Claire warned. "They'll put you in a hospital. Force you to take medication. Try to cure you of your beliefs."

"They tried before." The man smiled, showing gaps where teeth should be. "October 1966. They dragged me away, locked me up, told me the lighthouse didn't need me. But I came back. I always come back. The light calls me. And I must answer."

Allison was photographing him openly now, with his apparent permission. Documenting this encounter, this conversation, this moment of connection with someone who existed outside normal reality.

"Do you want us to tell them not to come?" Brian asked. "We could call it off. Say we were mistaken."

The man considered this. "No. Let them come. Let them try again. Maybe this time they'll understand. Maybe this time they'll see what I see—that the light needs a keeper. That machinery alone is not enough." He looked at each of them in turn. "You understand a little, don't you? You've felt the island. Felt the watch I keep. You know I'm not mad. Not in the way they think."

Claire thought about the past week. The fear, the sabotage, the psychological warfare. But also the devotion. The commitment. The absolute certainty of purpose.

"I think," she said carefully, "that you've found meaning in a place where most people would find only isolation. Whether that's madness or enlightenment, I don't know."

The man nodded, seeming satisfied with that answer. "The boat is waiting. You should go. The storm may return tomorrow. You want to be safe on the mainland when it does."

They walked back to the dock together, this strange procession of researchers and keeper. Frank watched them approach, his expression wary, hand near the radio in case he needed to call for help.

At the dock, the man stopped. "Thank you," he said. "For trying to understand. For not destroying what you found here. Most people would have just called me crazy and had me removed. You tried to see."

"We still don't know who you are," Allison said.

"I am the keeper of Whitmore Point." The man touched two fingers to his forehead in a kind of salute. "I have kept the light since 1967. I will keep it until I die. That is all you need to know."

They boarded Frank's boat. As Frank started the engine and turned toward the mainland, Claire looked back. The man stood on the dock, watching them leave. Then he turned and walked toward the lighthouse, hand trailing along the white stone as he climbed the path.

By the time they reached open water, he had disappeared into the tower, climbing to his post in the lamp room. Keeping watch. Maintaining his vigil.

Forever serving the light that had saved him—or that he believed had saved him.

Forever the keeper.

That night, back at the inn, they debated what to tell the Coast Guard. The truth—that they'd spoken with him, that he refused to leave, that he believed himself to be the resurrected keeper who'd drowned in 1967.

Or a version of the truth—that someone dangerous and delusional was on the island, that he needed removal and treatment for his own safety.

In the end, Claire made the call. She told Lieutenant Chen everything. The conversation in the caves, the man's claims, his absolute refusal to leave. She described his condition—malnourished but functional, delusional but not violent, living in conditions that would kill most people but that he'd survived for fourteen years.

Chen listened without interruption. When Claire finished, he was quiet for a moment. Then: "We'll handle it carefully. Psychiatric evaluation first. If he's competent to make his own choices, even strange ones, we can't force him to leave. If he's not... well. We'll get him the help he needs."

"He doesn't want help," Claire said. "He wants to keep his light."

"I know," Chen said. "But sometimes what people want and what they need are different things."

After the call, Claire joined her team in the inn's common room. They sat by the fire, processing everything, knowing that tomorrow the Coast Guard would go to the island and the keeper's life—whatever form it took—would change.

"Do you think it's really him?" Brian asked. "Silas Grant, somehow alive after fourteen years?"

"I think," Claire said, "that whoever he is, he's committed to being the keeper. Whether he was born Silas Grant or became him or exists somewhere between—it doesn't matter. He's the keeper now. That's his entire identity."

"And tomorrow they take that identity away," Allison said softly.

They sat in silence, watching flames dance in the fireplace, thinking about a man alone on an island, keeping watch over empty seas, maintaining a vigil no one asked for and few would understand.

Tomorrow, the authorities would come.

Tomorrow, the mystery would end—or begin anew.

But tonight, the lighthouse beam swept through darkness, regular as a heartbeat.

And the keeper stood watch.

As he always had.

As he always would.

Until they took him away.
