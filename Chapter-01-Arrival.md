# Chapter 1: Arrival

The fog came in thick off the Atlantic, turning the world to grey soup. Claire Ashford gripped the rail of Frank Garrison's fishing boat as it cut through the swells, the diesel engine's rhythm steady beneath the deck. She could taste salt on her lips, feel the October chill working through her flannel shirt despite the wool sweater layered underneath. Somewhere ahead, invisible in the murk, Whitmore Point Lighthouse waited.

"There," Frank said, his first word in twenty minutes. He pointed starboard.

The lighthouse emerged from the fog like a ghost materializing—a white tower rising sixty-five feet from a dark mass of granite. The beacon wasn't lit yet, mid-afternoon sun still providing enough light, though you couldn't tell it from the grey pressing in on all sides. Claire studied the island as Frank throttled back the engine. Two acres, maybe. Sparse vegetation clinging to rock. The lighthouse stood on the highest point, with a weathered grey cottage hunched beside it and what looked like an equipment shed near the waterline.

"Cheerful place," Kate Morrison said from behind Claire. The marine equipment technician stood with her legs spread for balance, tool belt already strapped on, auburn hair whipping in the wind. "Real postcard material."

"It's perfect," Brian Holloway countered, clutching his camera bag like a lifeline. The graduate student had gone pale green during the crossing, but his enthusiasm remained intact. "An 1883 lighthouse, fully automated since 1966. Do you know how rare it is to get research access to—"

"Save it for your dissertation," Kate said, not unkindly. "Right now I need you to help unload gear without dropping anything in the ocean."

Claire smiled despite her own nerves. Three days of planning, six months of grant writing, and two years of divorce-induced workaholism had led to this moment: seven days on an isolated island studying coastal erosion patterns. Her reputation at the University of Maine depended on this research. The data would be pristine—no variables except wind, water, and stone.

And apparently fog thick enough to cut with a knife.

"Coming alongside," Frank announced. The boat angled toward a wooden dock that looked older than the lighthouse. "High tide. Got maybe four hours before she's inaccessible again."

Allison Wade appeared from the stern, her vintage Nikon already raised. The freelance photographer had been shooting the approach in silence, moving around the boat like a ghost herself. "The light's incredible," she said softly. "Even through the fog. Especially through the fog."

Frank snorted, bringing the boat parallel to the dock with practiced precision. He killed the engine and the sudden silence felt like pressure against Claire's ears. Just wind. Waves against rock. The creak of wood and rope.

"All right," Claire said, shifting into leader mode. "Let's get unloaded. Kate, you and I will handle the surveying equipment. Brian, you've got the supply crates. Allison, whatever you can carry that won't break if you drop it."

"Thanks for the vote of confidence," Allison said, but she was smiling.

Frank secured the boat with quick, efficient movements. He was a big man, barrel-chested and weathered, with a white beard and hands like granite. He'd said maybe fifty words during the three-hour crossing from Boothbay Harbor. Claire got the impression he thought they were idiots for wanting to spend a week out here.

He might be right.

The dock swayed under their feet as they transferred gear. Surveying equipment in waterproof cases. Food supplies in military surplus crates. Claire's geological sample kit. Kate's repair tools and spare parts for the equipment. Brian's archive of lighthouse documents and his battered cassette recorder for taking notes. Allison's photography gear, film stock, and developing chemicals.

Frank watched them work, smoking a hand-rolled cigarette. Finally, he spoke. "Generator's temperamental. Needs the choke pulled twice, and don't flood it. Fuel's in the shed, locked. Key's on the hook by the cottage door."

"Got it," Kate said. "Diesel or gas?"

"Diesel. You know engines?"

"Navy, four years. I can keep it running."

Frank nodded, something like approval crossing his face. "Water's from the cistern, rainwater collection. Drink it or don't, your choice. I boil mine." He took a drag, eyes on the lighthouse. "Radio's marine band only. Emergency channel's monitored, but don't expect fast response time. Coast Guard's station is ninety minutes away in good weather."

"We'll be fine," Claire said with more confidence than she felt. "Back in seven days, right? Same time?"

"Weather permitting. Storm comes through, could be longer." Frank dropped his cigarette, crushed it under his boot. "Forecast's clear through the weekend, though. Should be all right."

Should be. Claire noticed he didn't sound convinced.

They made three trips up from the dock, carrying equipment along a gravel path to the keeper's cottage. The building had the exhausted look of abandoned things—paint peeling, windows dark, porch sagging slightly. But the structure seemed sound. The lighthouse loomed beside it, close enough to touch, the white paint turned grey in the fog.

Brian couldn't stop staring at it. "Can we go inside? The lighthouse, I mean. Is it locked?"

"Later," Claire said. "Let's establish base camp first."

By the time they'd transferred everything, Frank was ready to leave. He stood on the dock, hands in his jacket pockets, looking at them with an expression Claire couldn't quite read. Concern? Pity?

"Seven days," he said. "I'll be here at high tide, fourteen hundred hours. Don't be late, tide waits for no one."

"We won't be," Claire assured him.

Frank nodded slowly. His eyes moved from her to the lighthouse and back. "Used to be a keeper here. Man named Silas Grant. Ran the light for twenty years, right up until automation. They say he loved this place more than makes sense."

"What happened to him?" Brian asked immediately, already pulling out his notebook.

"Drowned," Frank said flatly. "Long time ago. Just saying—island gets in your head if you let it. Don't let it."

With that cryptic warning, he descended to his boat. The engine coughed to life, blue smoke mixing with fog. Frank cast off without ceremony, swung the bow around, and throttled up. Within thirty seconds, the fog had swallowed him whole. The engine sound faded gradually, then died.

They stood on the dock in silence.

"Well," Kate said finally. "That wasn't ominous at all."

Claire laughed, surprised by how good it felt. "Come on. Let's see what we're dealing with."

The cottage was worse inside than out. Most of the furniture had been removed when the lighthouse was automated, leaving just a few iron bedsteads, a wood stove in the kitchen, and empty shelving units. Dust covered everything. The windows were streaked with salt and grime. But the walls were solid, the roof looked intact, and the wood stove drew properly when Kate tested it.

"Home sweet home," Allison murmured, photographing the decrepit kitchen.

Claire assigned sleeping spaces—two upstairs bedrooms for her and Allison, two downstairs for Kate and Brian. They spent the next hour doing basic setup: unloading supplies, testing the generator (Kate got it running on the second try), confirming the marine radio worked, organizing the kitchen with their food stores.

Outside, the afternoon was dying. Claire checked her watch—a Timex with a leather band, nothing fancy. Quarter past five. Late October this far north meant sunset around five-thirty.

"I want to do a quick island survey before dark," she announced. "Just a walk around, get familiar with the layout. Everybody up for it?"

They were. Despite the exhaustion of travel and unloading, curiosity won out.

The island revealed itself in pieces as they explored. Western side: a rocky cliff dropping forty feet to churning surf, spray thrown up by waves hitting stone. Eastern side: accessible tide pools and tumbled boulders, with dark openings that might be caves at the waterline. Northern and southern tips: just rock and sparse sea grass, everything shaped by wind.

The lighthouse dominated. Up close, it was massive—base diameter at least twenty feet, walls thick enough to withstand a century of Atlantic storms. The door was unlocked. Inside, a spiral iron staircase disappeared upward into darkness, each step ringing hollow under their feet.

"Tomorrow," Claire told Brian, who looked ready to climb all sixty-five feet right now. "Plenty of time."

The equipment shed was locked, as Frank had said. Through the grimy window, Claire could make out basic maintenance equipment, fuel drums, spare parts for the automated beacon.

By the time they completed the circuit, the sun was setting somewhere beyond the fog. And then, precisely as darkness fell, the lighthouse beacon activated.

The light swept over them without warning—brilliant white beam cutting through grey, rotating slowly, rhythmically. Fifteen seconds of darkness, then the beam again. Hypnotic. Automatic.

"Wow," Brian whispered.

Claire had to agree. There was something primal about it. A light in the darkness, warning ships away from the rocks. Doing its job without human intervention, without awareness, without care. Just mechanism and purpose.

They returned to the cottage as the beam swept overhead again. Inside, Kate had the generator running and a few battery-powered lamps set up. Allison started heating water on the propane stove for coffee. Brian spread his historical documents across the kitchen table, already lost in research. Claire stood at the window, watching the lighthouse beam cut through the fog.

Seven days. She could do this. They all could.

"Claire?" Allison stood beside her, voice low enough the others couldn't hear. "Does it feel like we're being watched?"

Claire turned, studying the younger woman's face. Allison wasn't prone to dramatics. If anything, she was the calmest of them all. "What do you mean?"

"I don't know." Allison wrapped her hands around her coffee mug. "Just a feeling. Since we arrived. Like there's someone else here."

Claire looked out at the darkness between lighthouse sweeps. Fog, rocks, water. Nothing else. "It's the isolation. Frank said it gets in your head."

"Yeah." Allison didn't sound convinced. "Probably."

But she didn't move away from the window, and neither did Claire. They stood together, watching the light sweep across an empty island, as the first night on Whitmore Point began.

Outside, in the darkness beyond the beam, something watched them back.
