# Chapter 20: The Coast Guard Signal

The standoff on the catwalk couldn't last.

Kate inched closer from the left, wrench gripped white-knuckled. Claire approached from the right, hands open, non-threatening, still trying to talk him down. Between them, Silas Grant clung to the railing, staring at the rocks sixty-five feet below where he'd supposedly drowned fourteen years ago.

Wind screamed. Fog swirled. The narrow metal walkway felt like a tightrope over oblivion.

Allison watched from the doorway, camera forgotten, mind calculating distances and dangers. If Silas jumped, they couldn't stop him. If they rushed him, he might take Kate or Claire over the rail with him. The situation was unstable, balanced on a knife's edge.

Inside the lamp room, Brian leaned against the wall, shoulder throbbing, watching through the glass. Watching Kate and Claire edge closer to the cornered madman. Watching Silas's grip loosen on the railing, his body lean outward, testing gravity.

They were going to lose him. Either he'd jump, or he'd fight, or he'd do something desperate that got someone killed. The standoff couldn't resolve peacefully—not with a man who had nothing left to lose except the lighthouse he loved more than his own life.

Brian's eyes found the beacon mechanism. The massive Fresnel lens. The control panel. The automated systems that kept the light burning night after night without human intervention.

The thing Silas loved. The thing Silas would die for.

Kate's heavy wrench sat on the floor where she'd dropped it to climb the stairs. Brian picked it up. The weight was solid, purposeful. He looked at the control panel—glass displays, circuit boards, wiring harnesses, the electronic brain that ran the automated beacon.

One swing. That's all it would take.

Kill the light. Force Coast Guard investigation. End this nightmare within hours instead of days.

But destroy the thing Silas lived for. The thing that gave him purpose, identity, meaning.

Brian raised the wrench.

Outside on the catwalk, Kate was close enough to grab Silas now. Claire was talking, voice urgent but gentle. Silas's eyes were distant, already half-gone, deciding whether to jump.

"I'm sorry," Brian whispered.

He swung.

The wrench hit the control panel with a sound like breaking bones. Glass shattered. Circuit boards cracked. Sparks flew. Brian swung again, and again, methodical destruction, smashing every display, every connection, every vital component.

The beacon died.

The great rotating light that had swept these waters every night for fifteen years went dark. The motor stopped its eternal turning. The Fresnel lens sat motionless, blind, dead. Darkness fell over the lamp room—not the physical darkness of night, but the psychological darkness of purpose extinguished.

From the catwalk, a sound like nothing human.

Silas screamed.

Not anger. Not rage. Pure anguish, a howl of grief so profound it cut through wind and fog and the crash of waves below. He crumpled to his knees on the narrow walkway, hands flying to his head.

"No no no NO—"

Kate lunged forward, grabbed his arm. Claire seized the other. Together they hauled him upright, supporting his suddenly limp weight.

"What have you DONE?" Silas's voice cracked, breaking. "She's blind she's BLIND—"

They wrestled him through the doorway, back into the lamp room. He didn't resist. The fight was gone, drained out of him like blood from a wound. He stared at the dead beacon, the shattered control panel, the motionless lens.

"The ships," he whispered. "They'll crash. They'll all crash. The rocks will call them and she won't answer and they'll crash—"

Kate and Claire lowered him to the floor. He sat, rocking, arms wrapped around his knees like a child. Tears streamed down his weathered face into his matted beard. He was making a sound—a keening, rhythmic grief, like mourning at a funeral.

Because that's what this was. A death. The death of the light he'd served, the purpose he'd died for, the meaning of his existence.

Brian stood over the destroyed control panel, wrench hanging from his hand, shaking. The violence of what he'd done—the finality of it—hit him all at once. His hands trembled. His shoulder throbbed where Silas had struck him. He felt sick.

"Had to," he said to no one. "We had to. It's the only way."

Kate was already moving, pulling equipment cables from her tool belt. "Help me restrain him. Before he recovers."

Claire hesitated. "He's not resisting."

"He's in shock. It won't last." Kate's voice was hard, practical, but her eyes were troubled. "We restrain him humanely, make sure he can't hurt himself or us, and we wait for Coast Guard."

Together they bound Silas's hands in front of him—cables wrapped carefully, not tight enough to cut circulation, but secure enough to prevent violence. He didn't fight. Didn't acknowledge them. Just rocked and whispered apologies to the dead lighthouse.

"I'm sorry. I'm sorry I failed you. I'm sorry I couldn't protect you. I'm sorry—"

Allison knelt beside him, watching his face. The madness was still there, but something had broken. The manic energy was gone, replaced by hollow despair. He looked ancient now, impossibly old, like a man who'd outlived his reason for living.

"Silas," she said softly.

He didn't respond. Eyes fixed on the dark beacon, seeing nothing else.

Kate checked her watch. "Beacon's been dark for three minutes. Coast Guard monitoring station will notice within the hour. Standard protocol is to investigate immediately—navigational aids failing is a priority response. They'll have a boat here by morning, maybe sooner."

"We did it," Brian said, but there was no triumph in his voice. "We signaled for rescue."

Claire looked at the shattered control panel, the bound prisoner, the dead light. "Yes. We did."

The victory felt like ash in their mouths.

"Can you walk?" Kate asked Silas. No response. She looked at Claire. "We need to move him. Can't leave him up here."

Together they hauled him to his feet. He stood docile, weight supported between them, feet moving mechanically when they guided him. Allison led the way down the spiral stairs. Brian followed, cradling his injured shoulder.

The descent was slow, careful. Silas walked like a sleepwalker, present physically but absent mentally. Every few steps, he'd stop and whisper to the lighthouse—apologies, promises, broken fragments of devotion.

"I'll fix her. I'll make her see again. I won't leave her blind. I won't—"

"Keep moving," Kate said, not unkindly.

They reached the base of the lighthouse. Outside, fog still pressed close, but the absence of the beacon was palpable—a wrongness in the rhythm of the island, like a heartbeat that stopped. The darkness felt heavier.

Brian looked up at the tower. No light swept from the top. No beam cut through fog. For the first time in fifteen years, Whitmore Point Lighthouse stood dark.

Ships navigating these waters tonight would notice. Coast Guard would notice. And soon—very soon—boats would come.

They guided Silas across the open ground toward the cottage. He moved like a puppet, legs functioning but mind elsewhere. Halfway there, he stopped suddenly, head tilting, listening to something they couldn't hear.

"The others," he whispered.

Kate's grip tightened on his arm. "What?"

"They heard." His voice was distant, wondering. "The light died. They heard her die." He turned his head, looking back at the dark lighthouse, then at the rocks, the tide pools, the fog-shrouded edges of the island. "They're coming."

"Who's coming?" Allison asked.

Silas smiled, a terrible empty expression. "The others. The keepers. The ones who stayed. The light held them, kept them bound, gave them purpose. But you broke the light." He looked at Claire with something like pity. "You freed them. And they don't know how to be free."

"He's hallucinating," Kate said. "Psychotic break. Ignore it."

But Allison felt ice slide down her spine. The others. The keepers Silas had written about in his journals. The ones who drowned. The ones who stayed.

In the fog, something moved. Maybe. Probably just wind and imagination and fear. But maybe something else.

"They're coming," Silas said again, calm now, certain. "You'll see. When darkness falls. They'll come to the light. They always come to the light."

They got him into the cottage, down into the root cellar—the only space with a solid door and stone walls. Laid him on the floor, left him water, made sure his restraints weren't too tight. He sat against the wall, still whispering to the absent lighthouse, tears drying on his face.

"I failed you. I'm sorry. I failed—"

Claire closed the cellar door, secured it. The four of them stood in the kitchen, exhausted, battered, trying to process what they'd done.

"Beacon's dark," Kate said, checking her watch again. "Coast Guard will notice soon. Boat dispatched within hours. We just have to last until dawn."

"And then this is over," Brian said.

"And then this is over," Claire confirmed.

But outside, fog swirled around the dark lighthouse. And somewhere in that grey emptiness, Silas Grant's whispered warning echoed.

The others are coming.

Night was falling. The beacon was dark. And they were alone on the island with a madman who claimed he'd drowned and returned.

Who claimed others had done the same.

Who claimed the breaking of the light had freed something that should have stayed bound.

Allison looked out the cottage window at the gathering darkness. At the lighthouse standing silent and blind. At the rocks where keepers had drowned over decades of lonely service.

And she wondered—not for the first time, not for the last—what they'd really unleashed when they killed the light.

The wind picked up, carrying sound that might have been waves or might have been voices.

The fog thickened.

And somewhere in the cellar below, Silas Grant wept for his dead purpose and warned of the dead keepers coming home.

Morning felt very far away.
