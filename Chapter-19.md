# Chapter 19: Trapped in the Tower

The lamp room was a cathedral of glass and light.

Even dormant—beacon shut off until nightfall—the space felt massive. Glass panels enclosed the automated mechanism: the huge Fresnel lens, the rotating mount, the control systems. All spotless, maintained obsessively despite automation. Silas's work. His devotion made visible.

He stood with his back against the beacon housing, driftwood club trembling in his hands, chest heaving from the climb. Cornered. Desperate. The glass walls reflected his image back at him from every angle—a gaunt ghost in layers of rotting clothing, white hair wild, eyes fever-bright with mania and exhaustion.

"Stay back." His voice cracked. "I'll break it. I swear I'll break it all before I let you touch her."

Kate edged left, flanking. Claire held position at the stairwell. Allison stayed behind them, camera ready. Brian leaned against the wall, clutching his bleeding shoulder.

The lamp room was twenty feet across, circular, dominated by the beacon at its center. Nowhere to hide. Nowhere to run except—

Silas's eyes darted to the exterior door. The catwalk. Kate saw it too, shifted to block his path.

"Don't," Kate said, voice hard. "There's nowhere to go out there."

"Then I'll jump. I've drowned before. I can drown again. But you won't hurt her. Not while I'm here to stop you."

"We're not here to hurt the lighthouse," Claire said, stepping forward carefully. "Silas, listen—"

"NO!" He swung the driftwood at the beacon, stopped inches short. "You LIE. The last ones lied too. Said they were inspecting, checking, keeping her safe. Then they FIRED me. Took me away. Said I was sick, dangerous, said—" His voice broke. "Said she didn't need me anymore."

The pain in those words was raw, genuine. Sixty-five years old—or seventy-five, if he was really Silas Grant—and he sounded like a child being abandoned.

"You can't take her from me!" The mania surged back, eyes wild. "I died for her! Drowned in November cold, felt the water fill my lungs, sank into darkness! She brought me back! She needed me and she brought me back! I'm the keeper! I KEEP THE LIGHT!"

He was breaking down, the fragile psyche shattering under pressure. Kate looked at Claire, a question in her eyes: do we rush him now, while he's unstable?

Claire shook her head minutely. Not yet.

"Silas." Claire's voice was gentle but firm, the tone she'd use with a skittish animal. "I know you've been the keeper. I know how much this lighthouse means to you. We've read your records."

He blinked, confusion cutting through mania. "My records?"

"From the Coast Guard. From your service." Claire took another careful step. "You were appointed keeper in 1945. After the war. Navy service, then this posting. You served twenty-one years. Twenty-one years of faithful service."

The driftwood lowered slightly. He was listening.

"The records say you were the best keeper Whitmore Point ever had." Claire was making this up, reading him, giving him what he needed to hear. "Never missed a night. Kept the light burning through the worst storms. Ships navigated safely because of you. You saved lives, Silas. How many lives did you save?"

"Hundreds," he whispered. "Thousands, maybe. The rocks—they call to ships. I answered back. Kept them away. Kept them safe."

"You did." Claire nodded. "You were a good keeper. The best. The lighthouse was safe because of you."

His whole body was shaking now, driftwood drooping. The wall of mania cracking, exhaustion and grief flooding through. "Then why did they take her from me?"

"Because they didn't understand." Claire moved closer, slowly, like approaching a wounded animal. "They didn't understand how important the work was. How much you cared. They saw automation as progress, but they didn't see—couldn't see—that the lighthouse needed more than machinery. She needed someone who loved her."

Tears cut tracks through the grime on his weathered face. "She needed me."

"She did. She does." Claire was close now, just ten feet away. "And you've stayed with her. Even after they fired you, even after—" She paused delicately. "Even after everything that happened in 1967. You came back. You stayed."

"I can't leave her." The whisper was anguished, broken. "If I leave, who will keep the light? Who will answer the rocks? Who will watch for the ships?" His pale eyes found Claire's, desperate for understanding. "Who will care?"

For a moment—one crystalline moment—they saw him clearly. Not a monster or a madman, but an exhausted old man who'd given everything to a purpose that no longer needed him. Who'd found meaning in service and lost himself when that service was taken away. Who was so devoted, so consumed by love for an inanimate object, that he'd literally died rather than abandon it.

Or believed he had. In his fractured mind, the drowning was real, the return was real, the lighthouse's need was real.

Claire's voice was soft. "Silas, she'll be safe. I promise you, the lighthouse will be safe. But you're hurt. You're sick. You need help. Please—"

The moment shattered. Fear flooded back into his eyes, delusion snapping closed like a trap.

"You're trying to trick me." He backed harder against the beacon, driftwood rising again. "You want to take me away. Lock me up. Leave her alone. Let her die." His breathing accelerated, panic building. "No. No. I won't go. I won't leave. I WON'T—"

He broke for the door.

Kate lunged to intercept but he was faster, driven by terror and intimate knowledge of the space. He hit the exterior door with his shoulder, the metal slamming open, and vanished onto the catwalk.

Wind roared through the open door, carrying fog and salt spray. Kate swore and plunged after him. Claire followed. Allison grabbed Brian's good arm.

"Can you make it?"

He nodded, jaw tight. "Go. Document this."

Allison stepped through the door and the world tried to rip her off the tower.

Wind at this height was vicious, unimpeded by landmass, screaming in from the Atlantic with nothing to slow it. The catwalk was a narrow metal walkway, maybe three feet wide, circling the lamp room's exterior. Railing on the outside—waist-high, metal bars, designed for maintenance workers in calm weather, not for this. Glass lamp housing on the inside, slick with condensation. And below—

Allison made the mistake of looking down. Sixty-five feet to rocks and churning surf. The world tilted. Her stomach lurched. She grabbed the railing with both hands, camera swinging on its strap.

"Don't look down!" Kate shouted over the wind. She was edging along the catwalk to the left, wrench still in hand. Claire moved right, trying to flank Silas from the opposite direction.

Silas stood on the far side of the tower, facing the ocean, gripping the rail. Wind whipped his white hair, plastered his rotting clothes to his skeletal frame. He looked like a scarecrow, like a ghost, like something already dead that forgot to fall down.

"Silas!" Claire called, voice barely audible over wind. "Come inside! It's not safe out here!"

He didn't turn. Stared out at the fog-shrouded water, the rocks below, the place where he'd supposedly drowned fourteen years ago.

Kate advanced from the left, slow and careful on the narrow walkway. Her knuckles were white on the rail. Former Navy, but even she was scared at this height, in this wind. Claire moved from the right, equally cautious.

Allison and Brian blocked the door. Silas was cornered. Nowhere to go but through them or over the rail.

The wind screamed. Fog swirled. Below, waves smashed against rocks in rhythm with the lighthouse beam that would sweep these waters tonight—if they didn't disable it first.

Silas turned to face them. Tears and salt spray on his ruined face. Driftwood club forgotten, dropped somewhere in his flight. Just an old man in a rotting coat, cornered on a walkway sixty-five feet above the sea.

"I died here," he said, voice surprisingly calm, carrying over the wind. "November 1967. Storm night. I took a boat, rowed back to her. They said I couldn't keep the light anymore. Said automation made me obsolete. But I knew—I knew she needed me."

He looked at the rocks below.

"Waves took the boat. I went into the water. So cold. Colder than anything. Felt my lungs fill, felt myself sinking, felt the dark close over me." His eyes were distant, remembering. "Should have died. Did die, maybe. But something—she—pulled me back. Pulled me out of the water, out of death, back to purpose."

"Silas," Claire said gently, now just fifteen feet away, "you didn't die. You survived. You've been living here, in secret, for fifteen years. It's possible. Difficult, but possible. You didn't die and come back. You just never left."

He smiled sadly. "I know what I felt. I know what happened. You can believe it or not. Doesn't matter." He looked at each of them in turn—Kate with her wrench, Claire with her compassion, Allison with her camera, Brian bleeding and frightened. "What matters is the light."

"The light is automated," Kate said. "It doesn't need—"

"Everything needs care." Silas's voice was firm, certain. "Everything needs someone who watches over it. Machines fail. Automation breaks. But devotion—" He touched his chest, over his heart. "Devotion never fails. Love never fails. I keep the light because someone must. Because I must."

He was crying openly now, tears streaming into his beard, but his voice didn't waver. "And if I can't keep her, then I have no purpose. I'm just a dead man who forgot to stay drowned."

Claire and Kate were close enough to grab him now, both approaching carefully. Silas saw, tracked their movements. His hands found the railing again, gripping tight.

"Don't," he whispered. "Please don't make me leave her. Please."

"We're trying to help," Claire said, hand extended. "Come inside. We'll figure this out together."

"There's nothing to figure out." His grip tightened on the rail. "Either I keep the light, or I don't exist at all."

Wind howled. Fog pressed close. The catwalk felt like the only solid thing in a world of grey and void.

Silas Grant, keeper of Whitmore Point Light, stood trapped between two women trying to save him and the sea that had claimed him once already.

Looking down at the rocks, breathing hard, weighing his options.

And they all knew—Kate and Claire and Allison and Brian—that they'd pushed him too far, cornered him too completely.

That a man with nothing left to lose is the most dangerous thing in the world.

Even a dead man. Especially a dead man.

The wind screamed, and Silas wept, and the tower swayed beneath them like a ship in a storm.

Sixty-five feet above the rocks where keepers drown.

Always have. Always will.
