# Chapter 15: The Journals of Silas Grant

They spread the three journals on the cottage table like evidence at a crime scene. Which, in a sense, they were—evidence of a crime against sanity itself, committed slowly over fifteen years.

Brian had chosen strategically when grabbing them from the lair. The earliest journal, its cover faded to grey. A middle-period volume from 1974. And the most recent, 1980-1981, its pages still crisp.

"Handwriting first," Claire said, laying out samples side by side. "We need to establish if this is one person or multiple."

They compared entries from different years against each other and against the official lighthouse logs from Silas Grant's keeper years. The handwriting was consistent—same slant, same pressure, same idiosyncratic formation of certain letters. The 'g's always with an exaggerated lower loop. The 't's crossed with a slight upward curve. The capital 'L' that looked almost like a lighthouse itself, vertical with a small platform at the base.

"Same person," Brian confirmed. "Or someone who studied his handwriting obsessively enough to replicate it perfectly across thousands of pages."

"The forgery explanation doesn't work," Kate said. "Why would anyone do that? What's the motivation for faking fifteen years of journals written by a dead man?"

Allison opened the earliest journal. October 1966. The first entry was dated October 15th—the day Silas Grant's employment was officially terminated.

*They took my keys today,* the entry began. *Thirty-six years of service. Thirty-six years of keeping her light burning, guiding ships safely past the rocks. They said I was "no longer fit for duty." Said I showed signs of "psychological distress." They don't understand. They can't understand. The light isn't just machinery. She's alive. She needs me. Without a keeper, without someone who truly understands, she's just stone and glass. Dead matter. But with me, she lives. She protects. She saves.*

The entries continued through November and into December. Desperation bleeding through every word. Silas—if it was Silas—had tried everything. Appealed to the Coast Guard. Written to senators. Even contacted newspapers, trying to convince someone, anyone, that lighthouse automation was dangerous, that human vigilance mattered, that he should be reinstated.

All appeals were denied.

By late December, the entries shifted. No longer pleading for official recognition. Now planning something else.

*December 28th: I will return to her. They can't stop me. I know the waters, know the tides. I can reach the island in my dinghy. Live rough if necessary. Keep watch even without official sanction. She needs a keeper. I am her keeper. That is all that matters.*

January 1967 entries documented life in Boothbay Harbor, living rough, doing odd jobs for cash, avoiding authorities who he feared would institutionalize him. All while watching the lighthouse from the mainland, binoculars pressed to his eyes every evening, counting the fifteen-second intervals, making sure the automated system was functioning.

Then November.

*November 16th, 1967: Tomorrow. Storm forecast, but that's ideal. No one will expect me to cross in bad weather. By the time they realize I'm gone, I'll be with her. Back where I belong. The others will understand. Thomas and William and James—they all drowned trying to reach their lights. I will succeed where they failed. She is calling me. I must answer.*

November 17th had a single entry:

*The crossing.*

Then nothing. Blank pages. The journal skipped forward to February 1968, leaving a three-month gap that felt like a held breath.

When the entries resumed, the handwriting was shakier, as if written by someone relearning motor control. But it was recognizably the same hand.

*February 4th, 1968: I drowned. I crossed over. The water took me—cold, dark, final. I felt my body fail, felt consciousness slip away. The last thing I saw was her light, sweeping across the storm. Calling me. And then... the others were waiting. Thomas and William and James. The keepers who drowned before me. They showed me how to stay. How to exist between. How to return. The light brought me back. I woke on the rocks, alive when I should have been dead. I understand now. I died to serve. I returned to serve. I am the keeper. Forever.*

The group sat in silence. Outside, the real lighthouse beam swept past the cottage windows. Fifteen seconds of light. Fifteen seconds of dark.

"He survived," Kate said finally. "Obviously. The 'drowning' was hypothermia, near-death, hallucination. He nearly died in the crossing, washed up on the island, revived. The brain creates narratives to explain trauma. This is that narrative."

"For three months?" Allison asked quietly. "Where was he for three months? The Coast Guard searched. Frank recovered a body. There was a funeral."

"Wrong body," Kate insisted. "Or misidentification. Or Silas was never on the boat that capsized. We don't know what really happened that November."

Brian was already reading the 1974 journal, flipping through pages of daily entries. "The middle years are... detailed. Ship tracking, weather observations, maintenance notes. He's documenting everything. Every vessel that passes Whitmore Point, its name, registry, course, speed. He records climbing into the lighthouse to check the automated systems. Cleaning the lens. Replacing bulbs. Adjusting timers."

"Trespassing and vandalism," Kate said. "He's breaking into a federal lighthouse facility."

"He's maintaining it," Allison countered. "Making sure it functions. Isn't that what a keeper does?"

The 1974 entries also showed the dissociative shift Brian had noticed in the lair. Early entries used "I" and "me." By mid-year, they'd shifted to "the keeper" and "he."

*July 12th, 1974: The keeper checked her light today. All systems functioning. A tanker passed at 0340 hours, course 042, safely guided. The keeper's vigil continues. The others approve.*

"He's talking about himself in third person," Brian said. "Classic dissociation. The individual identity is subsumed into the role. He's not Silas Grant anymore. He's the abstract concept of 'the keeper.'"

"Or he's documenting someone else," Kate tried. "Another person he's observing."

But the context made that impossible. The entries were first-person observations written in third-person language. A fractured identity, not a separate observer.

Claire examined the most recent journal, dated 1980-1981. The entries from October showed the keeper's awareness of the research team's arrival and his immediate interpretation of their presence as a threat.

*October 12th: Invaders today. Four people claiming scientific purpose. But the keeper knows the truth. They want to assess her, study her, find weaknesses. Perhaps they plan to recommend decommissioning. The lighthouse is old, they'll say. Vulnerable to erosion. Expensive to maintain. Better to demolish and build something newer elsewhere. The keeper cannot allow this. Will drive them away. Gently if possible. Forcefully if necessary.*

Day by day, the entries documented his campaign of psychological warfare. The moved supplies, the carved messages, the sabotage. All described in calm, methodical language, as if reporting on weather patterns rather than harassment.

*October 14th: Removed their dinghy's drain plug. Must make them feel trapped, helpless. Must make them want to leave on their own. The keeper does not wish to harm them. Only to protect her.*

"He's not violent," Allison said, reading over Claire's shoulder. "Look at the language. He's trying to scare us away, not hurt us. Every action is calculated to make us leave without forcing physical confrontation."

"So far," Kate said. "These entries stop days ago. Who knows what he's planning now that we've invaded his lair, stolen his journals?"

Brian was photographing pages, documenting everything. The researcher's instinct even now—preserve the evidence, analyze later. But his hands were shaking slightly. The implications were catching up with him.

"Fifteen years," he said. "This spans fifteen years. Continuous habitation from late 1967 or early 1968 until now. One person, living alone on a barren rock, with minimal resources, in cave systems that flood with every tide. Surviving Maine winters that drop below zero. Surviving complete isolation. That's... I don't know if that's humanly possible."

"Obviously it is," Kate said. "Because someone did it. We've seen him. Gaunt, malnourished, mentally ill, but alive. Human beings are remarkably resilient when they have purpose."

"Or when they're already dead," Allison said softly.

Everyone turned to look at her.

"I'm not saying I believe in ghosts," Allison continued. "But I'm saying that what we're seeing doesn't fit normal parameters. The survival logistics. The consistency of purpose across fifteen years. The 'crossing over' language. The conversations with dead keepers. Either this is the most dedicated human being who ever lived, or..."

"Or what?" Kate challenged. "Say it. Or he's actually the ghost of Silas Grant, returned from the dead to keep his lighthouse?"

"I don't know," Allison admitted. "But neither do you. None of us do. We're looking at evidence that doesn't fit our frameworks, so we're forcing it into shapes that make sense. But what if it doesn't make sense? What if we're dealing with something genuinely impossible?"

Claire rubbed her temples, feeling a headache building behind her eyes. Five days ago, she'd arrived on this island to study coastal erosion. Five days ago, her biggest concern was collecting good data for her research. Now she was sitting in a fortified cottage, reading the journals of a possibly-dead lighthouse keeper, debating whether they were dealing with extreme mental illness or actual supernatural phenomena.

"We need Frank," she said finally. "Frank saw Silas Grant's body. Frank can tell us if the man in the caves could possibly be the same person. That's our anchor point. That's the fact we can verify."

"Frank comes tomorrow," Brian reminded her. "Eighteen hours."

"Then we wait," Claire said. "We secure this cottage, we keep watch, and we wait for Frank to give us the one piece of information that might make sense of this."

They spent the next hour reinforcing their defenses, checking their supplies, preparing for another night on the island. The journals sat on the table, evidence of either the longest delusional episode in psychiatric history or something that defied rational explanation entirely.

As darkness fell, the lighthouse beam began its rotation. Fifteen seconds of light. Fifteen seconds of darkness. The rhythm that had guided ships for a century. The rhythm one man—dead or alive, sane or mad—had devoted fifteen years to protecting.

Somewhere on the island, the keeper watched. Missing three of his forty-seven journals. Knowing the invaders had been in his lair, seen his shrine, violated his sanctuary.

Tomorrow, Frank would come.

Tomorrow, they would learn whether the dead could keep a lighthouse.

Tonight, they just tried to survive until morning.
