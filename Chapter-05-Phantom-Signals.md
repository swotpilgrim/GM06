# Chapter 5: Phantom Signals

Claire woke to grey dawn and static. The marine radio in the cottage was active, crackling with white noise.

She grabbed her sweater and went downstairs. The radio sat on the shelf, power light glowing green. She hadn't turned it on. None of them had.

Kate appeared, already dressed. "Been going for ten minutes. Woke me up."

Claire examined it. Standard marine transceiver, emergency channel 16 selected. She reached to turn it off, then froze.

The log book. She flipped it open to an entry she hadn't written.

"0317 hours. Mayday call transmitted. Channel 16. Canceled 0323 hours."

Three-seventeen AM. Six minutes of an active distress call, then canceled. Her handwriting, but she hadn't written it. Someone had used the radio during the night, logged it properly, then shut it down.

"Kate," she said quietly. "Look at this."

Kate read the entry, her face going hard. "Someone called for help. Then called it off before anyone could respond."

"Why?"

"Testing. Seeing if we'd notice. Or—" Kate's expression shifted. "—seeing if the Coast Guard monitors this channel actively. If they responded fast, he'd know we could call for help. If they didn't..." She didn't finish the sentence.

Claire felt cold. The marine radio was their lifeline. Their only way to summon help if things went truly wrong. Someone had tested it like a scientist running an experiment.

Brian stumbled downstairs, hair sticking up. "What's going on?"

"Our friend made a phone call," Kate said. "Metaphorically speaking."

They gathered around the radio as Claire explained. Brian's face went pale. Allison, joining them last, just nodded like she'd expected something like this.

"He was in the cottage," Brian said. "Last night. While we were sleeping. He came inside and used the radio."

"The door was barricaded," Claire said.

"He got in anyway."

That was the part that made Claire's skin crawl. Not just that someone had entered—that they'd done it silently, carefully, without waking anyone. Moved through the cottage like a ghost, operated equipment, made log entries, and disappeared.

"I'm checking everything," Kate announced. She moved through the cottage systematically, examining windows, doors, their supplies. Claire joined her.

They found more violations.

Claire's research notes—the yellow legal pad she'd been using to document geological observations—had been moved. Not stolen, just... read. Pages were out of order. Someone had flipped through them, studying her work.

Allison's camera bag had been opened. Film canisters examined but not taken. The Nikon itself showed fingerprints on the lens that weren't Allison's—smudged, grimy marks like someone with dirty hands had picked it up.

Brian's historical documents, which he'd left organized in three neat stacks, had been spread across the table and restacked differently. Not damaged, just rearranged. Touched. Invaded.

"It's psychological warfare," Kate said. She stood in the center of the cottage, hands on her hips, surveying the evidence. "He's not stealing. He's not destroying. He's letting us know he can access anything, anytime. He's establishing dominance."

"Why?" Allison asked. Her voice was small.

"Because he wants us gone. And the best way to drive someone away isn't violence—it's making them feel unsafe in their own space. He's contaminating our security."

Claire hated that Kate was right. The cottage no longer felt like shelter. It felt like a stage where they performed for an invisible audience. Every action observed, every possession handled, every moment of sleep a vulnerability.

"We set up a real watch," Claire decided. "Not just sitting in the kitchen. Active patrols. Two people awake, one inside, one outside. We catch him in the act."

"And then what?" Brian asked.

Good question. Claire didn't have a good answer.

While Kate reinforced windows and Brian checked their food, Claire examined the radio. Whoever used it knew maritime protocols. Correct frequency, proper procedure, perfect log formatting.

She thought about Silas Grant. Twenty-one years as keeper. That required maritime training—navigation, radio operation, emergency procedures.

But Silas was dead.

"Claire," Brian called from upstairs. "You need to see this."

She climbed to the second floor. Brian stood in the keeper's old office, holding a manila folder.

"I've been reading Silas's personnel file," he said. "His psychiatric evaluation from 1966, the one that got him fired. Listen to this part." He read aloud: "'Subject exhibits delusional attachment to lighthouse mechanism. Believes his consciousness is required for proper function. States automation represents existential threat to maritime safety. Claims ability to feel ships approaching and hear rocks calling to vessels. Diagnosis: severe obsessive-compulsive disorder with delusional identity disturbance. Subject presents with paranoid ideation regarding replacement and obsolescence. Recommends immediate removal and psychiatric treatment.'"

"We know he was mentally ill," Claire said.

"Yeah, but look at this next part." Brian flipped pages. "The evaluation includes interview notes. The psychiatrist asked Silas what would happen if he left the lighthouse. Silas's response: 'The light will go dark. Not the beacon—that's just machinery. The true light. The one that keeps ships safe. Without a keeper, there is no light. There is only darkness and rocks and death.'"

The lighthouse beam swept past the window. Fifteen seconds of light, then shadow.

"He didn't just think the lighthouse needed him," Brian continued. "He thought he WAS the lighthouse. That his presence was what made it work, not the machinery. Removing him was like... I don't know, removing the soul from a body."

"That's insane," Kate said from the doorway. "Which is the point. The man was seriously disturbed."

"But dedicated," Allison said softly. She'd appeared behind Kate, quiet as always. "He loved the lighthouse. Twenty-one years alone on this rock. That's not just duty. That's devotion."

Claire looked at the evaluation in Brian's hands. She thought about someone so identified with a place that being removed felt like death. And then actually drowning trying to get back.

"We're threatening him," she said.

They all looked at her.

"Whoever's out there—whether he's copying Silas's delusion or... or whatever—we represent the same thing Silas's automation represented. We're measuring the island, documenting erosion, assessing the lighthouse's structural integrity. We're scientists determining if this place is safe, viable, worth maintaining."

"So?" Kate said.

"So in his mind, we're here to kill the lighthouse. To declare it unsafe and shut it down. Just like automation killed Silas's purpose."

The thought settled over them like fog. They weren't just intruders. They were executioners.

"Then he's going to try to stop us," Brian said.

"He already is," Claire replied.

The afternoon was wasted. Claire tried collecting samples but kept scanning for watchers. Kate gave up surveying to fortify the cottage. Brian's hands shook photographing documents. Allison wouldn't go outside alone.

Dinner was canned stew, eaten in silence. Claire tried to rally them. "Tomorrow we search the caves at low tide. We confront him, establish our right to be here. This ends tomorrow."

She hoped she sounded confident.

They set up the new watch system: Claire and Kate would take the first shift, midnight to 3 AM. Brian and Allison would take 3 to 6. Real patrols, active monitoring, catching him if he tried to enter again.

Claire volunteered to walk the exterior while Kate guarded the cottage interior. She bundled up—wool sweater, jacket, work boots—and stepped out into the night.

The lighthouse beam swept overhead, her only companion. She walked the perimeter slowly, flashlight off to preserve night vision, letting the beacon's rhythm guide her. Fifteen seconds of light showing her the empty island. Fifteen seconds of darkness where anything could approach.

On her third circuit, she heard it.

A voice.

Not close, but not far. Coming from the direction of the lighthouse. A man's voice, low and steady, speaking in a rhythmic cadence.

Claire froze, listening.

"...forty-three degrees, fifteen minutes north. Sixty-nine degrees, forty-eight minutes west. Distance eight nautical miles. Bearing zero-niner-zero. Safe passage..."

Coordinates. Maritime navigation. Someone was reciting ship positions.

The voice continued, emotionless as a weather report. "...forty-three degrees, twenty minutes north. Sixty-nine degrees, fifty-two minutes west. Distance six nautical miles. Bearing one-one-five. Rocky shoal, maintain distance..."

Claire's hand found the flashlight on her belt but didn't turn it on. The voice was close to the lighthouse but not inside it—somewhere in the rocks nearby, hidden by darkness and fog.

"...forty-three degrees, eighteen minutes north. Sixty-nine degrees, forty-five minutes west. Distance three nautical miles. Bearing two-seven-zero. Safe passage under my watch. Kept the light. Saved them. Kept the light. Saved them..."

The last phrase repeated, a mantra. *Kept the light. Saved them.*

The lighthouse beam swept past, illuminating rocks and grass and fog. No one visible.

The voice stopped.

Claire stood in the darkness between sweeps, heart hammering. She counted to fifteen, waiting for the light to return. When it did, she saw nothing. Just the island, empty and cold.

But she'd heard him. Close. Real. Speaking in the language of keepers, of navigation and duty and ships saved from rocks.

She returned to the cottage. Kate saw her face and grabbed her wrench.

"What happened?"

"I heard him." Claire's voice was steadier than she expected. "By the lighthouse. Reciting coordinates. Ship positions. Like he was... tracking vessels offshore. Keeping watch."

"Did you see him?"

"No. But Kate—he sounded professional. Like official radio traffic. Maritime coordinates, bearings, distances. Not rambling. Not crazy. Precise."

"What was he saying?"

Claire repeated what she'd heard. The coordinates, the bearings, the repeated phrase: *Kept the light. Saved them.*

"That's keeper terminology," Brian said. He'd been listening from inside. "From the old logs. That's how they recorded their duty. 'Kept the light'—maintained the beacon through the night. 'Saved them'—ships that passed safely."

"But there's no ships out there," Kate said. "It's three in the morning. There's no traffic off the coast."

"He thinks there is," Allison said. "Or he's remembering. Playing it over and over. Keeping watch for ships that aren't there anymore."

The lighthouse beam swept past the window. Kept the light. Saved them.

Somewhere out in the darkness, a man who thought he was a lighthouse keeper stood watch over empty waters, reciting coordinates from memory or delusion, maintaining a vigil for vessels that would never know he was there.

And tomorrow, Claire thought, we're going into his caves. Into his hiding places. Into the spaces where he retreats between watches.

Tomorrow, the confrontation would begin.
