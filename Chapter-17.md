# Chapter 17: First Contact

Dawn came wrapped in fog so thick Allison could barely see her own hands. She stood at the western cliff edge, camera hanging from her neck, listening to the waves crash against rocks sixty feet below. Visibility maybe fifteen feet, twenty at most. The world had shrunk to a grey cocoon of moisture and muffled sound.

She shouldn't be out here alone. Claire's safety protocols were clear: never wander off solo, always within shouting distance. But after last night—the argument with Kate, the footprints, the sleepless hours—Allison needed solitude. Away from Kate's skepticism and Brian's nervous energy. Just her and the camera and the fog.

The lighthouse was invisible from here, swallowed by fog. Its beam had shut off at dawn, leaving the island in grey half-light. Allison raised her camera, framed a shot of rocks emerging from mist, the suggestion of tide pools, the ghost-world quality of morning fog on the Atlantic. The shutter clicked, loud in the muffled silence.

She moved along the cliff edge carefully, boots finding purchase on slick granite. Another shot: the keeper's cottage barely visible through fog, windows dark, looking abandoned. Another: the equipment shed, door hanging open, emptiness beyond. Atmospheric documentation for the grant report that would never be written. Evidence of a failed research mission. Pretty pictures of their prison.

The air tasted like salt and cold. Her jacket was already soaked through from fog condensation, hair plastered to her skull, skin clammy. October in Maine, the dying end of autumn. Winter coming fast across the water.

She turned to frame another shot and he was there.

Twenty feet away. Standing on the rocks. Watching her.

Allison's breath stopped. The camera hung forgotten against her chest. She couldn't move, couldn't speak, could only stare at the figure that had appeared without sound, without warning, as if condensed from the fog itself.

Impossibly thin. Emaciated to skeletal, body angles wrong, like something already half-dead. White hair hung past his shoulders, matted with salt and seaweed. White beard reaching his chest, strands stiff with brine. Pale blue eyes staring from a face weathered like driftwood, skin the texture of aged leather.

He wore layers—that was the second impression. Rotting layers of clothing, Coast Guard surplus from decades past, wool coat stiff with salt stains, canvas pants held together with wire and rope, rubber boots cracked and patched. Everything faded to grey-brown, the color of decay. His hands hung at his sides, gnarled and strong despite his emaciation.

Bare feet on the rocks. No boots after all—those were just wrapped rags. Bare feet on granite slick with fog and tide, toes splayed for balance, soles probably calloused beyond feeling.

He didn't move. Didn't approach. Just stood there watching her with those pale, empty eyes.

Allison's photographer instinct kicked in before her fear could paralyze her. Her hands moved automatically, raising the camera, checking the exposure in the dim light, framing the shot. The shutter sound was obscenely loud—click-CLACK—mechanical and final.

He didn't react to being photographed. Didn't blink. Just watched.

"Who are you?" Allison's voice came out steadier than she felt.

For a long moment, silence. Just the waves and the distant cry of gulls and the hammering of her own heart. Then he spoke.

"The keeper."

His voice was like gravel sliding over rock, rough and disused, as if speaking was a half-forgotten skill. Words shaped carefully, deliberately, each one an effort.

"Always was. Always will be."

Allison swallowed. Her mouth was dry despite the fog. "What's your name?"

Another pause. He tilted his head slightly, considering her question as if it was complex, requiring thought. When he answered, there was something like sadness in his ruined voice.

"Silas Grant. I keep the light."

The name hit her like cold water. Hearing it from his own mouth, spoken with such certainty, such simple truth. She'd known, theoretically, that the man stalking them claimed to be Silas Grant. But hearing him say it, standing there in the fog like something dredged from the ocean—

"Silas Grant drowned," she said. "In 1967. We found the funeral records. You're buried in Boothbay Harbor."

He smiled then. Missing teeth visible, gaps dark in his beard. Not a cruel smile. Almost gentle. Like she'd said something naïve but understandable.

"Drowned. Yes." He nodded slowly. "The sea took me. November storm. I remember the cold. The dark. Sinking." He looked past her toward the invisible lighthouse. "But she brought me back. The light needs a keeper. I serve the light."

Matter-of-fact. No drama, no defensiveness. Just stating simple truth as he understood it: he died, something brought him back, this is his purpose. The way someone might say they work at the post office.

Allison's hands were shaking. She lowered the camera before she dropped it. "Why are you doing this? The sabotage, the stalking, the—"

"You want to kill her." His voice hardened slightly, protective. "Measure her erosion. Declare her unsafe. They'll come and disconnect her. Ships will die."

"We're not—we're studying the island, not the lighthouse. We're geologists, we're—"

"You're here because of her." He gestured toward where the lighthouse stood invisible in fog. "Everything here is because of her. You'll write your reports. You'll say the island is unstable. They'll decommission her. They'll blind her. And ships will crash on the rocks." His pale eyes found hers again. "I can't allow that."

"The lighthouse is automated," Allison said, trying to keep her voice calm, reasonable. "It doesn't need a keeper anymore. It runs itself. Ships are safe because of the equipment, not because—"

"Equipment fails." He cut her off gently, absolutely certain. "I've seen it. The beacon stutters. The foghorn sticks. The light dims when storms come. Someone has to tend her. Someone has to keep watch. Someone has to care." His voice dropped, almost a whisper. "I care. I've always cared. That's why she needs me."

The delusion was complete, Allison realized. Total fusion of identity and purpose. He wasn't Silas Grant who kept a lighthouse. He was the keeping itself, inseparable from the function, existing only through service. Without the lighthouse to tend, he would simply cease to be.

It should have been pathetic. This ruined man, this living ghost, clinging to obsolete purpose. But standing there in the fog, looking at his absolute certainty, Allison felt something closer to horror. Because he believed it completely. And some part of her—the part that had been sensing wrongness since they arrived, that had seen him in impossible places, that knew things Kate's rationalism couldn't touch—some part of her believed him too.

"You need to leave," Silas said. Not threatening, almost pleading. "Before you make me hurt you. I don't want to hurt you." His hands flexed at his sides. "But I will protect her. I'll do whatever I must. She needs me. I died for her. I'll kill for her if I have to."

Allison's blood went cold. The matter-of-fact delivery made it worse. Not anger or mania, just simple truth: I will kill you to protect the lighthouse. The way someone might say it will rain later.

"We're leaving," she said quickly. "Two more days, then we're gone. We won't come back. We won't—"

But he was already backing away, dissolving into fog. Three steps and he was barely visible. Five steps and he was a shadow, a suggestion, a trick of mist and light.

"Two days," his voice floated back, disembodied. "Don't touch her. Don't go near her. Two days and you leave. Or I make you leave."

Then nothing. Just fog and rocks and the sound of waves. Allison stood frozen, scanning the grey emptiness, but he was gone. Vanished as silently as he'd appeared, leaving her alone on the cliff edge with her racing heart and shaking hands.

She waited, breathing hard, camera clutched to her chest. Waited for him to reappear, to attack, to do something. But the fog revealed nothing. He was gone.

Finally, her legs unlocked. She turned and ran.

Across the rocks, stumbling in fog, visibility too poor to see hazards, not caring. Past the equipment shed, toward the cottage, boots slipping on wet granite, camera bouncing against her ribs. Her breath came in gasps, fear and exertion and the thinness of fog-saturated air.

The cottage materialized from the grey. She hit the door hard, burst inside. Kate was at the table, jumped up at Allison's entrance. Claire emerged from the bedroom, alert. Brian looked up from his notebook.

"I saw him," Allison gasped, leaning against the closed door. "I talked to him. He was—" She stopped, gathered herself, tried to speak calmly. "I made contact. At the western cliff. He was just standing there."

"Jesus Christ, Allison—" Kate started, angry, but Claire cut her off.

"Are you hurt?" Claire crossed to her, checked her over with quick efficiency.

"No. He didn't—he didn't touch me. We just talked." Allison fumbled with her camera, hands still shaking. "I photographed him. Close range, good light. I got him."

Brian was already moving, clearing space on the table. "Tell us everything. Exactly what he said."

Allison nodded, took a breath, and began recounting the encounter. His appearance, his words, his warning. As she spoke, she saw it in their faces: belief, finally, that this was real. Not delusion or stress or supernatural fantasy. A man, living on this island, convinced he was Silas Grant, committed to protecting the lighthouse from any threat.

And in two days, they would either leave peacefully—or he would make them leave by force.

"He said his name," Allison finished quietly. "Silas Grant. He looked me in the eyes and said 'I keep the light.' Like it was the only truth that mattered."

"Did he seem violent?" Claire asked. "Aggressive?"

"He said he'd kill us if we threatened the lighthouse." Allison's voice shook slightly. "But he said it like—like stating a fact. Not angry. Just... certain."

Kate swore softly. Brian looked pale. Claire's jaw tightened, processing, strategizing.

"We have a photograph now," Claire said. "Clear identification. When Frank gets here, we give it to authorities. Let them handle this."

"Two days," Kate said. "We just have to last two more days."

Allison nodded, but her mind was still on the cliff edge, on those pale blue eyes staring at her through the fog. On the ruined voice saying I drowned. She brought me back.

She'd gotten her photograph. She'd made contact. She'd survived the encounter.

But the image of him standing there, impossibly thin and impossibly certain, would stay with her long after they left this island.

If they left this island.

Outside, the fog pressed against the windows. Somewhere in that grey emptiness, Silas Grant moved through his domain, keeping watch over the light.

Always the keeper.

Always.
