# Chapter 4: First Night Terrors

Nobody had slept. Claire could see it in their faces—grey skin, dark circles, jittery movements from nerves and bad coffee. Morning light filtered through fog to paint the kitchen in shades of exhaustion.

"All right," she said. "Let's hear it. What happened?"

Kate went first, voice flat and matter-of-fact. "The generator. Three AM, heard it sputter. Checked at first light—fuel tank was drained. Someone opened the valve, let the diesel run out."

"You're sure?"

"I'm a mechanic. I know sabotage." Kate's jaw was tight. "Whoever did it knows engines. Opened the right valve, made no noise. That's not amateur."

Brian shifted, hands wrapped around his coffee. "I heard someone in the lighthouse. Two AM. Boots on the iron stairs—that distinctive clang. Someone climbing toward the lamp room."

"Did you investigate?"

"Yeah." Brian's laugh had no humor. "Grabbed my flashlight, went in. Climbed to the top. Nothing. No one there. But I heard it, Claire."

Allison spoke last, barely above a whisper. "I saw him. The figure. Outside my window around one AM. Standing there in the fog. Watching."

"How long?"

"Thirty seconds. I thought I was dreaming. Sat up to look and he was gone." Allison pulled her sweater tighter. "But there were boot prints below the window. Fresh."

The lighthouse beam swept past the kitchen window. Fifteen seconds. Like a metronome counting down to something.

Claire rubbed her face. Two nights on this island and they were already seeing things, jumping at sounds, sabotaging each other's sleep with fear. Except Kate's generator was real. Drained fuel was measurable, provable.

"Okay," she said. "We're doing a full search of the island. Daylight, all of us together. If someone's hiding here, we're going to find them."

They armed themselves: Kate's wrench, a crowbar, Brian's heavy flashlight. Allison brought her camera. Claire carried her rock hammer, suddenly feeling inadequate.

The search took two hours. They moved methodically across two acres, checking every hiding spot. Behind rocks, in dense brush, around the lighthouse, in the equipment shed (which they broke into).

They found evidence.

On the northern tip, sheltered from the wind by an outcrop of granite, someone had made a nest of sorts. Not permanent shelter, just a windbreak. The rock still held the warmth of recent occupation. And scattered in the grass: hand-rolled cigarette butts. Maybe a dozen of them, old-style roll-your-owns.

"These are ancient," Kate said, examining one. "Nobody smokes like this anymore. You can buy cigarettes anywhere."

"Someone does," Brian said. He was photographing everything with his 35mm, the shutter clicking.

The footprints were everywhere once they knew to look for them. Boot prints, adult-sized, appearing and disappearing in patches of exposed dirt and mud. The trail led from the rock shelter to the tide pools on the eastern shore, then vanished at the water's edge.

"The caves," Claire said. "He's using the caves."

"At high tide those are completely submerged," Kate pointed out. "Nobody could survive in there when the water comes in."

"Maybe there are air pockets. Spaces above the tide line." Claire looked at the dark openings between the rocks, currently accessible as the tide was out. "Or maybe he times it. Comes in at low tide, leaves before high."

"That's insane," Brian said. "That would mean living by the tide schedule, moving every six hours, never sleeping for more than a few hours at a time."

"Or," Allison said quietly, "he doesn't sleep much. Doesn't need to."

They all looked at her.

"I'm just saying what we're all thinking. Whoever this is, they're not normal. Not... right."

Back at the cottage, Claire tried to organize her thoughts. They'd found evidence of habitation but no actual person. Cigarettes, footprints, sabotage—proof someone was here. But who? And why?

Brian had disappeared into his research. He sat at the kitchen table surrounded by the old logbooks and files he'd found, reading with an intensity that bordered on obsessive. His cassette recorder ran continuously, him muttering notes to himself.

"Brian," Claire said. "Take a break."

"No, listen to this." He held up a yellowed personnel file. "Lighthouse keepers for Whitmore Point since 1883. I've been going through the records. You want to know what the average tenure was?"

"How long?"

"Three years. The longest-serving keeper before 1945 was six years. Most lasted two or three before requesting transfer. The reasons cited are always the same: isolation, nervous strain, difficulty sleeping, auditory disturbances."

"Auditory disturbances?"

"Hearing things. Voices. Footsteps. Same stuff we're experiencing." Brian's eyes were bright with something between excitement and fear. "But then in 1945, Silas Grant was appointed. And he stayed for twenty-one years."

Claire felt something cold settle in her stomach. "Twenty-one years. On this island."

"Alone. No family, no regular visitors except Coast Guard inspections. Just him and the lighthouse." Brian flipped pages. "His early reports are normal. Proper maintenance logs, weather notations, ship tracking. But starting around 1960, the notes get... weird."

"Weird how?"

Brian read from a log dated October 1962: "'Light remains true. Ships pass safely under my watch. The rocks are quiet tonight. She is content.'" He looked up. "Who's 'she'? And why are the rocks quiet?"

Kate appeared in the doorway. "Let me guess. Silas Grant went crazy."

"The psychiatric evaluation from 1966 says 'delusional identification with lighthouse mechanism.'" Brian found the document. "He believed—actually believed—that his consciousness was linked to the lighthouse function. That automation would cause ships to crash because the lighthouse needed him specifically. Not just any keeper. Him."

"What happened to him?" Allison asked.

"Fired in October 1966 when he barricaded himself in the lighthouse for three days. Coast Guard had to forcibly remove him. He was spotted on the mainland after that, living rough, deteriorating mentally." Brian paused. "And then in November 1967, he drowned trying to row back here during a storm."

Silence. The lighthouse beam swept past.

"That's fifteen years ago," Claire said. "Silas Grant is dead."

"I know."

"So this can't be him."

"I know." But Brian didn't sound convinced. He sounded like someone trying to convince himself.

That afternoon, Claire pulled Kate aside while Brian and Allison were documenting the cigarette evidence.

"What do you really think?" she asked.

Kate leaned against the cottage wall, arms crossed. "I think someone's living here using the caves. I think they're territorial and don't want us here. I think they know this island better than we ever will, and they're trying to scare us off."

"Is it working?"

Kate smiled, but it didn't reach her eyes. "Little bit, yeah. But I don't scare easy, and I don't like being bullied. So I say we find this asshole and make it clear we're not leaving."

"What if he's dangerous?"

"Then we defend ourselves. Claire, I did four years in the Navy. I can handle myself in a fight. And if it comes to it, we outnumber him four to one."

Claire wanted to feel reassured. But something about the evidence bothered her. The patience of it. The systematic approach. Generator sabotage, lock tampering, the careful study of their routines. This wasn't a random drifter. This was someone with purpose.

Evening fell again, too quickly. They'd lost half the day to searching and fear. Claire's research was falling behind—she'd collected maybe an hour's worth of useful geological data. They were letting him win, letting the terror disrupt their work.

"We stick to the plan," she announced at dinner. "Tomorrow we search the caves at low tide. But tonight, we sleep in shifts again. Two people awake at all times. We secure the cottage as best we can. And we don't let him isolate us."

"And if we find him?" Brian asked.

"We talk to him. Explain that we have legal permission to be here. Ask him to leave peacefully."

"And if he doesn't?" Kate asked.

Claire didn't have a good answer for that.

They fortified the cottage as darkness fell. The iron bedstead still barricaded the door. They wedged chairs under window latches. Kate jury-rigged an alarm using cans and string—primitive but it would make noise if someone tried the windows.

Claire took the first watch with Kate. They sat in the kitchen, coffee going cold between them, while Brian and Allison tried to sleep upstairs.

"You ever been this scared?" Kate asked quietly.

Claire thought about lying, maintaining the leader face. But she was too tired. "Yeah. When my marriage was ending. When I thought my career was over. Different kind of fear, but..." She shrugged. "Fear's fear."

"This is different," Kate said. "This is primal. Like being hunted."

"We're not being hunted. We're being intimidated."

"What's the difference?"

Claire didn't answer because she didn't know.

At midnight, they heard it again. Footsteps circling the cottage, slow and deliberate. The same pattern as the night before. Around and around, gravel crunching underfoot, someone walking the perimeter like a predator marking territory.

Kate stood, wrench in hand. "I'm going out there."

"Don't—"

But Kate was already unlocking the door, shoving aside the barricade. She stepped out into the darkness between lighthouse sweeps, flashlight cutting through fog.

Claire followed, her heart hammering.

The footsteps stopped.

They stood in the cold and the fog, turning slowly, flashlight beams crossing and recrossing empty gravel. Nothing. No one. Just the island and the darkness and the lighthouse beam painting everything white for fifteen seconds before abandoning them again.

"Show yourself!" Kate shouted. "Stop hiding and face us like a man!"

Her voice echoed off the rocks and died in the fog. No answer.

But when the lighthouse beam swept past again, Claire saw them. Footprints. Fresh boot prints in the gravel, forming a complete circle around the cottage. Someone had walked around and around while they sat inside, and now—

There. At the edge of the light's reach, movement. A figure, just for a second, there and gone.

"Did you see that?" Claire whispered.

"Yeah." Kate's voice was tight. "I saw it."

They went back inside, locked the door, reset the barricade. Neither spoke about what they'd seen. Or thought they'd seen. The line between real and imagined was getting thinner.

In the morning, they would search the caves. They would find answers.

But tonight, in the dark, with the fog pressing against the windows and the lighthouse beam sweeping endlessly across an island that suddenly felt very small and very isolated, all they could do was wait.

And listen.

And hope that whoever was out there, whatever he wanted, he would wait just a little longer before making his move.
