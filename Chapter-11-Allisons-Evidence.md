# Chapter 11: Allison's Evidence

The storm forecast changed everything. They had to attempt communication today or never.

Claire gathered the team at dawn. "We leave one message. Clear, respectful, explaining we're departing and mean no harm to the lighthouse. Then we wait on the boat while the storm passes."

"If he doesn't accept it?" Brian asked.

"We call the Coast Guard. They handle it." Claire looked at them. "But I want to try peace first."

Allison spoke up. "I need to develop all my film first. Six days of shooting. We need it processed for evidence."

"How long?" Kate asked.

"Three, four hours."

Claire checked the weather. Storm not until evening. "Okay. Allison develops film. We write the message and prepare to depart. Back on the boat by noon."

They rowed the dinghy to shore. The island felt different in the pre-storm light. The fog had cleared, replaced by heavy clouds moving fast overhead. The wind carried the smell of coming rain.

While Allison set up her makeshift darkroom in the cottage bathroom, Claire worked on the message. She wrote it out by hand on paper torn from Brian's notebook, choosing her words carefully:

*To the Keeper of Whitmore Point:*

*We came to study the island's geology, not to harm the lighthouse. We understand now that this place is important to you, that you feel responsible for keeping watch. We respect that dedication.*

*We are leaving tomorrow. The lighthouse will remain as it is—automated, functional, standing watch as it has since 1966. Our presence here was temporary. Yours is permanent. We acknowledge that.*

*We mean no disrespect to the light or to those who served it. We ask only that you allow us safe departure.*

She showed it to the others. Frank nodded approval. Kate looked skeptical but didn't object. Brian suggested adding a line about the Coast Guard, about official records, but Claire shook her head. "Keep it simple. Keep it respectful."

They left the message weighted with rocks at the base of the lighthouse, where he'd carved his memorial. Where he'd left his wooden gift. A place he clearly considered sacred.

Then they waited.

Allison worked in the bathroom, the chemical smell of developer drifting through the cottage. Hours passed. Claire packed their remaining supplies. Kate did a final check of the equipment they were abandoning—most of it destroyed or contaminated beyond salvage. Brian organized his historical documents, wrapping them carefully in waterproof bags.

At eleven AM, Allison emerged from the bathroom carrying wet prints hung on a makeshift line of fishing wire. Her expression was strange—excited and frightened in equal measure.

"You need to see these," she said. "All of you. Now."

She spread the photographs across the kitchen table. Dozens of images from the past six days. The island, the lighthouse, the team at work. Atmospheric shots of fog and rock and beacon light.

And in the backgrounds, barely visible but unmistakable once you knew to look: the figure.

He appeared in photograph after photograph. Always distant, always watching. Sometimes just a dark shape in the fog. Sometimes more detailed—the gaunt frame, the layered clothing, the white hair.

"I didn't see him when I was shooting," Allison said. "Not in most of these. The camera saw things I missed. Or he moved between when I looked and when I clicked the shutter."

Brian examined the photos with growing fascination. "He's in... how many of these?"

"Seventeen," Allison said. "Out of forty-three shots. More than a third."

But the most striking image was from yesterday—Allison's photograph of the lighthouse beam at dusk. She'd been trying to capture the quality of light through fog. The photograph showed the beacon sweeping across the island, illuminating the lighthouse tower in stark white.

And in the lamp room window, sixty-five feet up, a face.

Gaunt, weathered, white-bearded. Looking directly at the camera. Eyes that reflected the beacon light like an animal's.

"That's him," Frank said quietly. He leaned close, studying the face in the photograph. "That's... Jesus. That could be Silas."

"Could be?" Kate asked.

"It's been fourteen years. People change. But the bone structure, the build..." Frank shook his head. "If I didn't know better, I'd say that was the man I pulled from the ocean in '67."

They stared at the photograph. The face in the window was too small for definitive identification, even with Allison's good camera and steady hands. But the resemblance to the funeral photo was undeniable. Same gaunt features, same intense stare, same sense of complete certainty.

"There's one more," Allison said. She held up a photograph she'd separated from the others. "I took this yesterday evening. My last shot before we left the island."

The photograph showed the carved memorial at the lighthouse base. The words *KEPT THE LIGHT 1945-1966. STILL KEEP THE LIGHT 1967-*

But this time, someone had added to it. Fresh scratches below the original carving:

*UNTIL THE LAST SHIP PASSES*

*UNTIL THE LAST KEEPER FALLS*

*FOREVER*

"He added that after we left yesterday," Allison said. "While we were on Frank's boat. He's making a promise. Or a prophecy."

Claire felt something cold settle in her chest. This wasn't just delusion. This was commitment. Total, absolute, eternal commitment to a purpose that existed only in his mind.

"We need to leave," she said. "Now. Before the storm. Before he decides we're still a threat."

They gathered their gear quickly. The photographs, the historical documents, their personal belongings. Everything else—the destroyed equipment, the contaminated supplies, the cottage they'd tried to make home—abandoned.

As they loaded the dinghy, Brian looked back at the island. "Do you think he'll read our message?"

"I think he's already read it," Claire said. "I think he's been watching us all morning."

They rowed to Frank's boat. The wind was picking up, whitecaps forming on the water. Frank started the engine, preparing to head for the harbor.

"Wait," Allison said. She was looking at the island through her camera's telephoto lens. "He's there. At the lighthouse. Watching us leave."

Claire grabbed the binoculars. Through the lenses, she could see the lamp room clearly. And yes—a figure stood at the window. Watching. One hand pressed against the glass. Even at this distance, she could see his posture. Not threatening. Not aggressive.

Mourning.

"He thinks we're taking the light with us," Allison whispered. "He thinks we're shutting it down."

"The light stays on," Frank said. "Automated. It'll keep running until the Coast Guard decides otherwise."

"He doesn't understand that," Claire said. "Or doesn't believe it. To him, keepers make the light work. Without keepers, there's only darkness."

Frank throttled up the engine. The boat turned, heading for the mainland. As they pulled away, the figure in the lamp room remained motionless. Standing watch. Keeping vigil. Alone again as he'd been for fourteen years.

The last thing Claire saw before distance and spray obscured the view was the lighthouse beam activating, even though it was still daylight. Sweeping across an empty island. Fifteen seconds of light, fifteen seconds of dark.

On and on and on. Forever.

They reached Boothbay Harbor as the storm arrived. Rain lashed the docks. Frank helped unload, then left to secure his own boat.

The team stood on the dock, suddenly back in civilization. It felt unreal.

"I'll call my advisor," Brian said.

"I'll handle the university," Claire added.

"I need sleep," Kate said.

They split up, planning to meet at the local inn that evening. To debrief. To decide what to report.

Claire called the university from a payphone. Her department chair listened—equipment sabotage, dangerous individual, forced evacuation. He promised to handle the grant committee. The research was lost, but her career wasn't over.

That evening, they gathered at the Boothbay Inn. A small room with a fireplace, warm and dry and safe. The storm raged outside, rain hammering the windows.

"So," Kate said. "What do we tell the Coast Guard?"

"The truth," Claire said. "Someone's living on Whitmore Point. Has been for years. Believes he's the lighthouse keeper. Exhibits delusional behavior and has engaged in sabotage. He needs psychiatric evaluation and removal for his own safety."

"And if they ask if it's Silas Grant?" Brian asked.

Claire thought about the photograph. The face in the lamp room window. The resemblance that was too close to be coincidence.

"We tell them we don't know," she said. "We tell them it could be. We give them Frank's testimony, the photographs, the journal. We let them investigate."

"And if it is somehow Silas?" Allison asked quietly. "If he did fake his death? If he's been out there for fourteen years?"

"Then he gets the help he clearly needs," Claire said. "Either way, this ends with proper authorities handling it."

They sat in silence, listening to the storm. Thinking about a man alone on a barren island, keeping watch over empty seas, maintaining a vigil no one asked for and no one would remember.

"Do you think he'll survive the storm?" Brian asked.

Frank, who'd joined them after securing his boat, nodded. "If anyone could, it's him. Fourteen years out there, he knows every cave, every shelter, every way to ride out weather. The storm won't kill him."

"But he's alone," Allison said. "Completely alone. Again."

"He's always been alone," Frank said. "That's the tragedy. Alone with his delusion. Alone with his purpose. Alone with his light."

Outside, lightning flickered. Thunder rolled across the harbor. And somewhere out in the storm, on a small island three miles offshore, a lighthouse beam swept through rain and darkness.

Still keeping the light.

Always keeping the light.

Until the last ship passes.

Until the last keeper falls.

Forever.
