# Chapter 26: The Funeral Records

The psychiatric evaluation took place in a sterile room at Boothbay Harbor Hospital. Dr. Margaret Chen—forty-two years old, forensic psychiatrist with fifteen years evaluating criminal defendants—sat across from the prisoner, tape recorder running, notepad open.

"Can you tell me your name?"

"Silas Grant. Keeper of Whitmore Point Light."

"And can you tell me today's date?"

"October 1981. Late October. Storm season." He paused. "But I don't track days anymore. Days don't matter when you're dead. Only purpose matters."

Dr. Chen made notes. "You believe you're dead?"

"I am dead. Drowned November 14, 1967. Storm night. Water temperature thirty-eight degrees. I capsized three-quarters of a mile from Whitmore Point, went under, breathed water, felt my heart stop. That's death. I experienced it. I know the difference between living and dying because I've done both."

"But you're alive now. Sitting here, talking to me. Breathing. Heart beating."

"Something that looks like life. Walks and talks and breathes. But I'm sustained by purpose, not biology. The lighthouse keeps me animate. Devotion keeps me conscious. Without that—" He gestured at himself. "I'm just a corpse that forgot to rot."

Dr. Chen's pen moved across the page. Classic dissociative identity disorder. Psychotic break from reality. Elaborate delusion system incorporating historical fact. But something about his testimony was unusual.

"Tell me about the drowning. What do you remember?"

Silas described it. Specific details: the feel of cold water burning his throat, the disorientation as waves tumbled him, the darkness as he sank, the pressure in his chest as his lungs gave up. The moment his heart stuttered and stopped. The absence that followed—not black, not void, just complete cessation of sensation.

"Then hands in the water," he continued. "Pulling me. Not up—sideways, toward the rocks. Multiple people, working together. I couldn't see them. Too dark. Too dead. But I felt their purpose. Their need. They dragged my body onto the rocks and somehow—I don't know how—they put me back inside it. Made it work again. Made me breathe."

"Who were they?"

"The others. The keepers who drowned before me. Still bound to the light. Still serving. They knew I'd die rather than leave her. So they showed me how to stay. How to exist between life and death. How to serve forever."

Dr. Chen paused. "You said hands pulled you. Can you describe them?"

"Cold. Stronger than living hands. Certain. They knew exactly what they were doing because they'd done it themselves. Come back after drowning. Stayed after death. Kept the light because keepers always keep the light." He looked at her directly. "You think I'm delusional."

"I'm evaluating your mental state."

"I know what I felt. I know where Coast Guard Petty Officer William Morrison and his crew found my body on November 17, 1967. I know they tried resuscitation for fourteen minutes before declaring me deceased at 11:47 AM. I know my body was transported to Boothbay Harbor, held at the morgue for three days while Frank Garrison arranged a funeral. I know all this because I was there—not in the body, but watching. Dead, but not gone. Waiting to go back."

Dr. Chen checked her notes. Those details—the date, the time of death declaration, the three-day morgue hold—matched public records. She'd reviewed the 1967 death certificate. This man either researched exhaustively or experienced what he claimed.

"I'm recommending psychiatric hold for further evaluation," she told him. "You're not a danger to yourself currently, but your belief system is fundamentally disconnected from reality."

"Or your reality is too narrow to include mine." He smiled sadly. "Either way, I'll go where you send me. I can't escape. I'm bound to the light. She'll call me back eventually. She always does."

The evaluation concluded. Dr. Chen's report noted: *Subject exhibits severe dissociative identity disorder with delusional content centered on drowning and resurrection. Unusually detailed memories of death experience suggest either elaborate research or genuine traumatic event that subject has reinterpreted through psychotic framework. Recommend indefinite psychiatric hold.*

In the bureaucratic machinery, other gears turned.

The prisoner's fingerprints—taken during processing—went to multiple databases. Local, state, federal, military. Standard procedure for unidentified individuals.

The military database returned a match.

Silas Grant, born March 14, 1906, Bangor, Maine. Navy service 1942-1945, Pacific theater, honorable discharge. Prints on file from enlistment records. Ten-point match confirmed. Biological certainty: the man in custody was Silas Grant.

But Silas Grant had been dead for fourteen years.

Detective Cooper received the results in his office, read them three times, then called in forensic specialists. They ran the prints again. Same result. Requested comparison with the 1967 death certificate fingerprints—those taken from the corpse. Same person. The dead body and the living prisoner had identical prints.

Cooper requested a medical examination. How old was the prisoner, biologically?

The doctor examined him: bone density, skin elasticity, cardiovascular function, general decline markers. Estimate: sixty to sixty-five years old. Born 1916-1921. Not 1906. A fifteen-year discrepancy.

"But the fingerprints match," Cooper said.

"I can't explain that. I can only tell you what the physical evidence shows. This man is approximately sixty to sixty-five years old, which would make him born around World War I. Not before it."

Cooper assembled the evidence: Fingerprints matched Silas Grant (born 1906, would be 75). Physical age suggested 60-65. Two witnesses with personal knowledge identified him as Silas Grant. Silas Grant died and was buried in 1967.

Something didn't add up. And there was only one way to resolve it.

"I'm requesting a court order to exhume cemetery plot one-two-seven at Boothbay Harbor Cemetery," Cooper told the judge. "If this man is Silas Grant, I need to know who we buried fifteen years ago."

The court order was granted. But exhumation required time—legal process, cemetery notifications, forensic team assembly. Three to five days minimum.

In the meantime, the research team gave full formal statements. Detailed accounts of their week on Whitmore Point, the sabotage, the confrontation, the capture. They provided the journals they'd taken from Silas's lair, Allison's photographs, Brian's historical research, all physical evidence.

Cooper reviewed everything, then asked the question he didn't want to ask.

"Did any of you experience anything... unexplained? Phenomena that don't have rational explanations?"

Allison spoke up. "I saw figures. Multiple times. People on the rocks, in the fog, during the storm. Standing where no one should be. Others saw them too."

Cooper wrote this down. "Hallucinations? Stress response?"

"Maybe," Kate said. "Or maybe there was something else on that island. Footsteps in the lighthouse when we were alone. Foghorn sounding when the mechanism was disabled. Wet footprints from a locked door. I can't explain it. I'm not saying it was supernatural. I'm saying I don't know."

"The journals mention 'the others,'" Brian added. "Previous keepers who supposedly drowned. Silas writes about them like they're present, real, guiding him. We heard footsteps—multiple sets—climbing stairs toward us. But we never found anyone else."

Cooper noted it all but his expression showed skepticism. Stress, exhaustion, suggestibility. Four people trapped with a madman who told ghost stories. Their perceptions couldn't be trusted.

"You're free to go," he told them. "But remain available for follow-up. This investigation isn't closed. We need to verify identity, explain the impossibilities, figure out what actually happened."

"What about our research?" Claire asked.

"The grant agency has been notified. They've canceled funding due to failure to complete the project. I'm sorry."

Months of planning. Professional reputation. Academic standing. Gone. But they were alive. That had to count for something.

The prisoner was transferred to Maine State Psychiatric Hospital in Augusta. Medicated, monitored, deemed non-violent but severely delusional. He spent his days in a secure room, drawing. Lighthouse diagrams with obsessive precision—every stone, every stair, every detail of the lamp mechanism. Maritime charts tracking ship positions in waters off Boothbay Harbor. Keeper logs documenting maintenance schedules for a lighthouse he could no longer see.

The staff reported he was calm, cooperative, polite. Never aggressive unless someone suggested the lighthouse didn't need him. Then brief agitation, quickly medicated into compliance.

"He's harmless," the attending psychiatrist said. "Lost in his delusion completely. He genuinely believes he died and returned. That belief is unshakeable. We can't reason him out of it because to him, it's lived experience. It's his truth."

Detective Cooper visited once, three days after admission.

"The exhumation is scheduled," he told Silas through the secure room's glass. "Plot one-two-seven. We're going to open the grave and see who's inside."

Silas looked up from his lighthouse drawing. "You'll find Silas Grant. Dead for fourteen years. Drowned body, properly buried. That's what you'll find."

"Then who are you?"

"Also Silas Grant. Dead for fourteen years. Drowned but returned. Both things are true. The dead body in the ground and the dead man drawing pictures. Both are Silas Grant." He smiled. "Death isn't as final as you think. Not when purpose calls louder than the grave."

Cooper left unsettled. The case file was growing, evidence accumulating, but understanding wasn't. Just more impossibilities stacking on top of each other.

Claire and her team checked into a Boothbay Harbor motel, waiting for the exhumation results, too invested now to leave without answers. They sat in Kate's room, comparing notes, trying to make sense of what they'd experienced.

"Fingerprints matched," Brian said, reviewing what Cooper had told them. "Biologically, that's Silas Grant. But he's not old enough. The aging doesn't match."

"Maybe he didn't die," Kate said. "Maybe the drowning was faked, different body buried, and he's been hiding for fifteen years. That would explain the age—he's actually fifty-five, just lived rough and looks older."

"Then whose body did they bury?" Allison asked. "Morrison and Frank both identified it as Silas. Tattoos matched. Dental records matched."

"Dental records can be faked. Bodies can be misidentified."

"Not with fingerprints. Not with multiple witnesses."

They went in circles. Evidence contradicted evidence. Rational explanations failed. Supernatural explanations were impossible.

"Maybe we'll never know," Claire said finally. "Maybe some things just... don't make sense. Can't make sense. Fall outside what we can understand."

Kate shook her head. "Everything has an explanation. We just don't have all the data yet."

But her voice lacked conviction. She'd heard the footsteps too. Seen the wet footprints from the locked door. Her materialism had cracks now that no amount of data would seal.

They waited. And on Whitmore Point, three miles offshore, a dark lighthouse stood in silence.

Waiting for the exhumation. Waiting for answers. Waiting for someone to fix the broken light.

Always waiting.

Always calling.

Always.
