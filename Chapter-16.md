# Chapter 16: The Believer and the Skeptic

The cottage kitchen smelled like burnt coffee and mildew. Claire spread the journals across the table, their water-damaged pages crackling under the harsh lamplight. Brian hovered at her shoulder, still cataloging entries, his notebook filling with dates and cross-references. Kate stood at the window, arms crossed, jaw tight. Allison sat in the corner, camera in her lap, quiet.

"Fifteen years," Kate said, breaking the silence. "That's what we're supposed to believe? Some old man living on a rock with no supplies, no support?" She turned from the window, gesturing at the journals. "This is delusion. Well-documented, but delusion."

"Then explain how he survived." Allison's voice was soft but steady.

"Hard living. Malnutrition. Fish, like he said. Seabirds. Probably stole from passing boats over the years." Kate ticked items off on her fingers. "It's not comfortable, but it's possible. People survive in worse conditions."

"For fifteen years? Alone?" Allison set her camera aside carefully. "With minimal aging? The photo Brian found from the funeral shows a man in his sixties. That was 1967. He should be seventy-five now. The man I photographed yesterday looks sixty, maybe sixty-five."

Kate's laugh was sharp. "You're basing that on a grainy newspaper photo. Rough living ages some people, preserves others. My grandfather looked fifty when he died at seventy-two."

"That's not the same—"

"It's exactly the same." Kate's voice hardened. "You're looking for supernatural explanations because it's more interesting than reality. Reality is some crazy old man squatted on this island, probably did fake his death to avoid institutionalization, and has been living rough ever since."

Claire held up a hand. "Kate—"

"No." Kate turned to face Allison directly. "I'm not doing this. I'm not sitting here entertaining ghost stories when we're trapped on this island with a real human threat." She jabbed a finger toward the journals. "That's a mentally ill man who's been gaslighting us for days. He's dangerous. He's delusional. But he's flesh and blood, and I'm not going to—"

"I'm not talking about ghosts." Allison stood, color rising in her cheeks. "I'm talking about evidence. Things that don't add up. He knows details about lighthouse operations from before automation. He's survived with no visible supply line. His journals describe 'drowning' and 'crossing over'—"

"Suggests!" Kate seized on the word. "Exactly. Suggests to you. Because you want it to be mysterious. You take pictures of 'liminal spaces' and 'American hauntings.' This is research material for you."

The accusation landed hard. Allison flinched. "That's not fair."

"Isn't it?" Kate's eyes were cold. "You've been seeing things since we got here. Figures in fog. Shadows in windows. Sounds that nobody else hears. And now you want us all to believe—what, exactly? That Silas Grant is a zombie? A ghost? That the lighthouse brought him back from the dead?"

"I'm saying I don't know what he is." Allison's voice shook slightly. "But I know what I've seen. What I've felt. And I'm asking you to consider—"

"I've considered it. It's bullshit." Kate turned back to the window. "We're exhausted, we're scared, we're under stress. That's why you're seeing things. That's why you're convinced there's something supernatural happening. But there isn't. There's just a crazy old man and four researchers who need to survive two more days."

"Kate." Brian tried to interject, voice conciliatory. "Maybe if we just look at all the evidence—"

"I've looked at the evidence," Kate snapped. "Fifteen years of paranoid ramblings written by someone who thinks he's married to a lighthouse. That's not evidence of the supernatural. That's evidence of severe mental illness."

"The footprints," Allison said quietly. "Last night. In the cottage. They were wet. Seawater. But the door was locked from inside."

Kate was silent for a moment. "Condensation. Humidity. This whole place is damp."

"They were shaped like feet. Leading from the door."

"Then one of us walked there and didn't remember. We're all sleep-deprived." Kate's voice had an edge now, defensive rather than dismissive. "The human brain fills in patterns. You saw some wet marks and interpreted them as footprints because you expected to see footprints."

"I know what I saw."

"You think you know what you saw."

"That's enough." Claire's voice cut through the argument with professional authority. Both women looked at her. "This isn't productive. Kate, Allison has made valid observations about inconsistencies. Allison, Kate's right that we're under extreme stress and our perceptions may be compromised." She looked between them. "But here's what actually matters: we don't know who or what we're dealing with, and we have two more days until Frank's scheduled return."

"If he returns," Kate muttered.

"He will," Claire said firmly. "He's contracted, he's reliable, and he knows these waters. We survive until pickup. That's the mission now."

Brian cleared his throat. "So what do we do?"

"Fortify. Defend." Claire gestured at the cottage. "We secure this building, we maintain watch rotation, and we avoid further confrontation with whoever is out there. We don't investigate. We don't engage. We wait."

Kate nodded, tension easing slightly. Allison said nothing, withdrawing back to her corner. The hurt was visible on her face—Kate's accusations, Claire's dismissal of her perceptions, the group's rejection of what she knew to be true. She picked up her camera again, a familiar comfort.

"I'll take first watch," Allison said quietly.

Kate's head snapped around. "You sure that's wise? Given that you're seeing things?"

"I'm seeing what's there." Allison met her eyes. "And someone needs to watch. I'm volunteering."

Claire hesitated, then nodded. "Two-hour shifts. Allison first, then Kate, then Brian, then me. Wake the next person on schedule, no matter what. And if you see anything—anything at all—you wake everyone. Understood?"

They murmured agreement. Brian helped Claire move the journals to a drier storage area. Kate checked the cottage doors and windows methodically, testing locks, examining frames. Allison sat at the kitchen table, camera beside her, waiting for the others to settle into whatever passed for sleep these days.

The cottage quieted. Brian's snoring drifted from the second floor. Claire's breathing evened out in the main bedroom. Kate had taken the couch near the kitchen, close to Allison's watch position, whether from protectiveness or distrust, Allison couldn't tell.

The lamp cast harsh shadows. Outside, fog pressed against the windows like something alive. The lighthouse beam cut through darkness every fifteen seconds, rhythmic and hypnotic. Allison watched the door, the windows, the darkness beyond.

An hour passed. Then another. Her watch said 2:47 AM when she saw him.

Standing on the rocks, perhaps thirty feet from the cottage. Just standing there, facing the building. Impossibly thin, white hair visible even in darkness, absolutely still. Watching.

Allison's breath caught. She grabbed her camera, aimed, but her hands were shaking too badly for a clear shot in low light. She needed Kate. Needed a witness. Needed someone else to see this.

She crossed to the couch quietly, touched Kate's shoulder. Kate woke instantly, military-sharp, eyes opening to full awareness.

"He's outside," Allison whispered. "On the rocks. Right now."

Kate sat up, looked past Allison to the window. Allison turned too.

The figure was gone.

"Fuck," Allison breathed. "He was there. Thirty seconds ago. Just standing there watching."

Kate was already moving to the window, scanning the darkness. "I don't see anything."

"He moved. Or vanished into fog." Allison joined her at the window, both women peering out into the night. The rocks were empty. The lighthouse beam swept across them every fifteen seconds, revealing nothing but stone and tide pools and darkness.

Kate started to speak, probably to say something dismissive about stress and exhaustion, when her gaze dropped to the floor.

Wet footprints.

Leading from the door—still locked, still bolted from inside—across the kitchen floor toward where they stood. Seawater pooling in the indentations, reflecting lamplight. Clear impressions of bare feet, toes visible, stride pattern evident. Someone had walked from the door to the center of the room while they'd both been here.

The door had never opened.

Both women stared at the prints. Kate crouched, touched one with her fingertip. Her finger came away wet. She sniffed it. Salt. Definite seawater, not condensation or humidity or any rational explanation.

"Kate—"

"I see them." Kate's voice was flat, controlled, but something had shifted in it. She stood, examining the door. Still locked, bolt thrown, chain secured. No way anyone entered. No way anyone could have left those prints.

She looked at the prints again, following their path from door to center of the room, then fading as the water ran out. The impressions were clear near the door, less distinct as they progressed, gone entirely after eight or nine steps. Like someone walking out of the ocean, dripping, then drying as they moved through the cottage.

Kate said nothing. Allison said nothing. They stood together in the lamplight, looking at the impossible footprints on the cottage floor.

Finally, Kate spoke. "Wake Brian and Claire."

"Should I—"

"Just wake them. Now."

Allison hurried upstairs. Kate remained at the window, arms crossed, staring out at the rocks where Allison had seen the figure. Where something had been standing. Where someone had been watching before walking through a locked door and leaving evidence of their passage.

When Claire and Brian came down, groggy and alarmed, Kate showed them the footprints without comment. Claire examined them with a scientist's eye—measured the stride, photographed them with Allison's camera, tested the water. Seawater, definitely. Fresh, still pooling slightly. From a locked door that no one had opened.

"I don't have an explanation," Claire said finally.

Kate laughed, a short, bitter sound. "Yeah. Join the club."

She didn't apologize to Allison. Didn't acknowledge their earlier argument. But when their eyes met across the kitchen, there was understanding. Something had happened here that shouldn't be possible. Kate had no explanation. Her materialism, her certainty, her rigid worldview—all inadequate to explain wet footprints from a locked door.

Allison saw it in her face: the first crack in Kate's absolute skepticism. Not belief. Not acceptance. But doubt. The beginning of uncertainty.

They kept watch together the rest of the night, all four of them, sitting in the kitchen with the impossible footprints slowly drying on the floor. No one slept. No one spoke much. And when dawn finally came, grey and cold through the fog, the footprints were gone—evaporated or absorbed into the damp wood, leaving no trace except the memory of having been there.

But they'd all seen them. All four of them, together. That was something. That was evidence, however impossible.

Outside, the lighthouse beam shut off as morning arrived. The island waited, patient and hostile, for whatever would come next.

Two more days until Frank's return. Two more days to survive.

If they could make it that long.
