# Chapter 12: Obsession Recognized

Brian couldn't sleep. The storm rattled the windows, but it was the journal that kept him awake. The keeper's log he'd kept instead of leaving behind.

He'd lied to the others. Slipped it into his bag while packing. Now, at two AM, he couldn't stop reading.

Volume fourteen. Thirteen others must exist in those caves. Fourteen years of daily logs, ships that never passed, maintenance on equipment needing no maintenance.

The 1966 psychiatric evaluation drew him back repeatedly: "Subject exhibits delusional identification with lighthouse mechanism. Claims ability to feel ships approaching and hear rocks calling to vessels."

A 1974 journal entry: *"Felt two vessels passing tonight. Couldn't see them through fog, but felt their mass, their engines' rhythm. Logged coordinates by feel alone. Together, we kept them safe."*

Not just delusion. Complete reality reconstruction. The keeper had developed a sensory framework validating his purpose. His brain created sensations matching his beliefs.

Every few entries referenced "the others." Dead keepers who supposedly visited, offered guidance.

Dissociative identity disorder, a psychiatrist would say. Or schizophrenia. Hallucinations from extreme isolation.

But the entries were too consistent. Too detailed. The handwriting never wavered. And the maritime knowledge was perfect—tide calculations, weather prediction, navigation. All matching what a trained keeper would know.

At three AM, Brian went looking for coffee. The lobby had a pot for early fishermen. He poured a cup, settled by the window.

"Couldn't sleep either?"

Allison stood in the doorway, blanket-wrapped, coffee in hand.

"Too much in my head," Brian said.

She sat across from him. "The keeper."

They sat in silence. Then Allison said, "He appeared in so many photographs without me seeing him. Always watching."

"Stalking," Brian said.

"Or protecting. Watching over us. Making sure we didn't hurt ourselves on his island."

"He sabotaged our equipment. Contaminated water."

"To drive us away. Not kill us. He could have. We were vulnerable. But he never attacked. Just scared us."

She was right. Despite everything, no violence. "Protective aggression," Brian said. "A keeper protecting his lighthouse."

Allison set down her coffee. "What if it's about purpose? Silas spent twenty-one years as a keeper. That's identity. When they automated it, told him he wasn't needed..." She paused. "What do you do when your reason for existing gets declared obsolete?"

Brian thought about his own doctorate, years studying maritime architecture. If someone said it was worthless, irrelevant?

"You'd fight," he said. "Find a way to keep doing it anyway."

"And if you were isolated enough, if the lighthouse was all you had..." Allison looked at the storm. "You might spend fourteen years on a rock rather than admit your purpose was gone."

"But Silas died," Brian said. "Frank saw the body."

"Maybe." Allison's voice was soft. "Or maybe Frank saw what he expected to see. A body, water-damaged, wearing Silas's clothes. Maybe the dental records were wrong. Maybe there was a mistake."

"You think Silas is alive. You think he's been out there for fourteen years."

"I think," Allison said carefully, "that someone out there has been keeping that light for fourteen years. Whether it's Silas Grant or someone who became Silas Grant or something in between—does it really matter? The person we encountered has devoted his entire existence to a purpose no one values except him."

Brian looked down at the journal in his hands. Fourteen years of daily entries. Thousands of hours maintaining a watch that served no function. Logging ships that weren't there. Protecting a lighthouse that needed no protection.

"It's the purest form of commitment," he said. "Doing something not for recognition or reward or even necessity. Just because you believe it needs to be done."

"Or the purest form of madness," Allison countered. "I can't decide which."

At dawn, Claire found them in the lobby, surrounded by journal pages and photographs. She looked exhausted, like she hadn't slept either.

"We need to talk," she said. "All of us. Now."

They gathered in Claire's room. Kate arrived last, looking rough. "This better be important. I finally got to sleep an hour ago."

Claire spread Allison's photographs across the bed. The ones showing the figure in the background, watching. The close-up of the face in the lamp room window. The carved messages at the lighthouse base.

"I've been thinking about what we report to the Coast Guard," Claire said. "About what story we tell."

"We tell the truth," Kate said immediately.

"Which truth?" Claire asked. "That there's a dangerous mentally ill individual on Whitmore Point? That Silas Grant may have faked his death fourteen years ago? That we encountered something we don't understand and can't explain?"

"All of it," Kate said. "Let them investigate. That's their job."

"And what happens to him?" Allison asked quietly. "To the keeper? When they find him?"

The question hung in the air.

"Psychiatric facility," Kate said. "Probably for life. He's clearly incompetent. Delusional. He can't take care of himself."

"He's been taking care of himself for fourteen years," Brian pointed out. "Living on a barren rock with minimal resources. Surviving storms, isolation, complete solitude. That's not incompetence."

"That's survival driven by insanity," Kate argued. "It's not a life. It's barely existence."

"But it's his existence," Allison said. "It's what he chose. Or what chose him. Either way—taking him off that island, putting him in an institution... we'd be killing him. Not his body. His purpose."

Claire rubbed her temples. "I don't like it either. But we can't just leave him there. What if he hurts someone? What if another research team comes and he escalates?"

"He didn't escalate with us," Brian said. "He could have. Multiple times. He chose intimidation over violence."

"So far," Kate said. "What about next time? What if he decides the next team is a bigger threat?"

They argued in circles for an hour. Kate insisting they had a moral obligation to report everything and let authorities handle it. Allison arguing they had an equal obligation not to destroy a life, however strange. Brian trying to find academic objectivity and failing. Claire caught between her responsibilities as a researcher and her growing sympathy for a man she'd never met.

Finally, Claire made a decision. "We report it. We tell the Coast Guard there's someone on the island who needs evaluation. We provide the photographs as evidence. But we don't speculate about identity. We don't claim it's Silas Grant. We let them investigate objectively."

"And if they ask our opinion?" Kate asked.

"We say we don't know," Claire said. "Because we don't. Not really."

That afternoon, Claire called the Coast Guard station. She spoke to Lieutenant Chen, the officer who'd come to the island days earlier. She explained the situation: someone living in the caves, exhibiting delusional behavior regarding the lighthouse, potentially dangerous.

Chen listened carefully. "We'll send a team out when the storm clears. Probably two days. Thank you for reporting this, Dr. Ashford."

"What will happen to him?" Claire asked. "If you find him?"

"Evaluation first. If he's mentally incompetent, we'll get him proper care. If he's just a squatter, he'll be removed and charged with trespassing." Chen paused. "But you said he's been there for years?"

"Based on the evidence, yes. At least a decade."

"Then he'll definitely need psychiatric help. No one survives that long in those conditions without severe mental illness."

After the call, Claire rejoined her team. They sat in her room, listening to the storm rage outside, thinking about the man on the island. About whether survival itself was proof of sanity or insanity.

"I want to go back," Allison said suddenly. "When the storm clears. Before the Coast Guard goes. I want to try talking to him one more time."

"Why?" Kate asked.

"Because maybe he'll talk to us now that we're leaving. Maybe he'll explain. Maybe we can understand." Allison looked at them. "I just want to know who he is. Really is. Not who we think he is or who the records say. Who he is in his own mind."

"That's dangerous," Kate said.

"I'll go with her," Brian offered. "I want answers too."

Claire thought about it. Two days until the Coast Guard came. Two days until the keeper's life—whatever form it took—would change forever.

"We all go," she said. "One more time. We go back to the island and we try to talk to him. Face to face. No threats, no ultimatums. Just communication."

"And if he won't talk?" Kate asked.

"Then we tried," Claire said. "And we let the authorities handle it from there."

Outside, lightning flickered. Thunder rolled across the harbor. And somewhere on Whitmore Point, a keeper stood watch through the storm, maintaining his vigil, protecting his light.

Obsessed, yes. Deluded, probably. But committed absolutely to a purpose he'd chosen or that had chosen him.

In two days, they would go back.

In two days, they would try to understand.

And whatever they found—ghost or madman or something in between—they would finally know the truth about the keeper of Whitmore Point.
