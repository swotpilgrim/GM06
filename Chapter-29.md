# Chapter 29: Allison's Photographs

Allison's Portland studio was a converted attic apartment—sloped ceilings, north-facing skylights, one corner transformed into a makeshift darkroom with blackout curtains and chemical trays. Two weeks had passed since they left Boothbay Harbor. Two weeks of trying to return to normal life, trying to process the impossible, trying to move on.

Allison couldn't move on. Not until she developed the final rolls of film.

She'd processed some on the island—the photos of Silas, the documentation of their imprisonment. But four rolls remained, shot during the chaos: the storm approach, the evacuation, the figures she'd seen but hadn't focused on, backgrounds captured while photographing foregrounds.

Now, in red safelight glow, she developed them carefully. Standard procedure: developer bath, stop bath, fixer, rinse. Images emerging from blank paper like ghosts materializing.

Contact sheets first. All the frames from each roll printed small on a single page, allowing her to see what she'd captured. She hung them to dry, examined them under magnification, marked frames for enlargement.

And saw them.

Background details she hadn't noticed when shooting. Human figures. Not in every frame—maybe one in five—but present. Standing on rocks, visible in fog, caught at the edges of composition. Always distant. Always slightly out of focus since her camera had been aimed elsewhere. But definitely there.

Brian arrived as she was printing enlargements. He'd called ahead, asked if he could help archive the photographic evidence for his dissertation. Permission granted. He needed witnesses anyway.

"Look at this," Allison said, showing him a contact sheet. "Frame twelve, background left. That's a person."

Brian studied it through her magnifying loupe. "Could be rock formation. Shadow. Pareidolia—our brains finding human shapes in random patterns."

"Check frame eighteen. Same roll, three hours later based on timestamps. Different location. Same figure."

Brian compared them. The figure was there—distant, blurred, but consistent in size and posture. "That's... unsettling."

They went through all four contact sheets methodically. Counted figures across different frames. Six distinct presences visible across forty exposures. Different locations on the island. Different times—dawn, afternoon, storm approach. Always at distance. Always imprecise. But human-shaped. Human-sized. And too consistent to be random.

"I need the historical references," Brian said.

He'd brought photocopies from his research: lighthouse keeper photographs from Whitmore Point records. Personnel files from 1880s through 1960s, documenting each keeper's tenure. Formal photographs—standard bureaucratic procedure for Coast Guard positions.

They compared. Allison's blurred background figures next to crisp historical portraits, looking for matches.

Frame twenty-three: distant figure on western rocks, posture suggesting hands in pockets, clothing silhouette. Brian placed it beside an 1880s photograph of James Whitmore, first keeper. Similar build. Similar stance. The historical photo showed distinctive brass buttons on his keeper's uniform coat, peaked cap standard for that era. The figure in Allison's photo—though blurred—showed similar clothing profile.

Frame thirty-one: figure near tide pools, different build, possibly shorter. Comparison with 1920s keeper Robert Patterson. Similar proportions. Patterson's photograph showed specific clothing cut—1920s style work jacket, flat cap. The blurred figure matched that silhouette.

Not definitive. Not proof. Too distant, too ambiguous, too open to interpretation. But unsettling in their consistency.

Kate arrived as they laid out comparisons on Allison's worktable. Announced, skeptical, arms crossed. "Brian said you found something. I'm here to provide rational analysis."

Allison showed her the photographs. The figures. The historical comparisons.

Kate examined them with technical precision. Checked negatives for manipulation—none found. Tested for double exposure—negative. Lens flare—wrong pattern. Developing errors—no evidence. Chemical contamination—impossible with her technique.

"These are legitimate photographs," Kate admitted grudgingly. "Whatever the camera captured, it actually captured. No darkroom tricks. No manipulation."

"So they're real?" Brian asked.

"Something was there when the shutter opened. Whether human figures or natural phenomena creating human-like shapes—that's interpretation." Kate pointed at frame twenty-three. "This could be a rock formation with specific lighting creating the illusion of a standing person. Pareidolia is powerful. We evolved to see faces and figures. It's survival wiring."

"In six different locations? With consistent size and proportion?"

"Coincidence. Statistical probability. Shoot enough photographs, some will have ambiguous shapes." But Kate's voice lacked its usual conviction.

Allison pulled one more photograph. "This is from the storm. You remember? When we were evacuating to the lighthouse. Lightning flash. I saw them then—told you about it. You said I was hallucinating."

The photograph showed the storm-lashed island. Rain, wind-blur, darkness. And in the background, illuminated by lightning: five or six figures standing on rocks. Clear enough to count. Too blurred to identify. But definitely there. Standing in hurricane-force wind that should have knocked anyone over.

Standing impossibly still in conditions that no living person could withstand.

Kate stared at it for a long time. Her hands, holding the photograph, trembled slightly.

"I saw them," she said finally. Voice quiet, reluctant. "During the storm. When the lightning flashed. I saw them and told myself it was hallucination. Stress response. But I saw them."

"Kate—" Allison started.

"I saw them and I lied. To you, to myself. Because seeing them meant accepting something impossible, and I don't—I can't—" She set the photograph down carefully. "But there they are. On film. Not hallucination. Not delusion. Actually there."

Brian picked up the storm photograph. "Six figures. Same as I counted in the contact sheets. Same as Silas claimed—seven keepers total, including him. The others. The ones who drowned and stayed."

Claire had been quiet until now, standing in the doorway, watching. She crossed to the worktable, examined the photographs one by one. The background figures. The historical comparisons. The storm image with its impossible standing figures.

"I saw them too," she said.

Three heads turned.

"In the lighthouse. That night when we heard footsteps. I aimed my flashlight down the stairs and for just a second—less than a second—I saw shadows that looked like people. Multiple people. Standing on the landing below us. Then nothing. Just empty stairs." Claire touched the photographs gently. "I told myself it was exhaustion. Stress. But I saw them."

The four of them stood around the worktable in red darkroom light, looking at evidence of the impossible. Photographic documentation of background figures that matched dead keepers. That appeared in conditions no living person could survive. That multiple witnesses had seen with their own eyes, independent of cameras and film.

"What do we do with this?" Allison asked.

"Nothing," Claire said. "We don't publish. Don't show anyone outside this room. Don't try to prove what happened. Because we can't. These photographs will be dismissed as artifacts, pareidolia, stress-induced mass hallucination. No peer review would accept them. No journal would publish them. Our careers would end."

"But we know the truth," Brian said.

"We know we experienced something. We have evidence of something. Whether that something was seven dead lighthouse keepers or a shared psychological event induced by isolation and fear—we can't definitively say." Claire looked at each of them. "But we were there. All four of us. We experienced it together. That's what matters."

"So we just... forget?" Kate's voice was hollow.

"We live with it. We carry it. We accept that some things can't be explained, can't be proven, exist outside our frameworks for understanding reality." Claire managed a tired smile. "Welcome to life after the lighthouse. Where certainty died and mystery survived."

Allison gathered the photographs carefully, placed them in an archive box. "I'll keep these. Safe. Documented. Not for publication. But for us. Proof that we weren't crazy. That the impossible is real, even if we can't prove it to anyone else."

Kate nodded. Still struggling with it, still fighting her materialist worldview, but cracked enough to admit uncertainty. "I heard them. Saw them. Can't explain them. That's all I know."

Brian made notes in his dissertation journal. "I'll write about Silas's psychology. The isolation effects. The journals. The forensic mystery. But not the figures. Not the footsteps. Not the supernatural elements. Just the documented human tragedy."

"And the photographs stay here," Allison confirmed. "Our secret. Our truth. Our proof."

They stood together in the red-lit darkness—four researchers who'd gone to study coastal erosion and found something much stranger. Four witnesses to the impossible, bound now by shared experience that would haunt and connect them for the rest of their lives.

Outside, Portland went about its evening. Cars and restaurants and normal people living normal lives, unaware that impossible things existed three hours north on a lighthouse island.

Unaware that seven dead keepers kept watch over dark waters.

Unaware that death wasn't as final as they thought, for those who loved their purpose more than life.

The photographs stayed in their archive box. The four witnesses went back to their separate lives. And the knowledge of what they'd experienced—impossible but true—lived on in the space between them.

Some truths are too strange to share.

Some evidence is too disturbing to publish.

Some mysteries stay mysteries.

And sometimes, that's the only answer possible.

In the darkroom, the photographs dried. Images of figures that might be dead men or might be shadows. Evidence of the impossible or evidence of nothing. Depending on who you asked. Depending on whether you believed.

But the four of them believed.

Because they'd been there.

Because they'd seen.

Because impossible or not, it happened.

And that would have to be enough.
