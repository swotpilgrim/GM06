# Chapter 10: Psychological Warfare

Claire and Allison waited at the sub-level entrance while Kate and Brian explored the darkness below. Fifteen minutes of silence. The lighthouse beam swept overhead—light, dark, light, dark. Fifteen seconds each way.

"Should we go down?" Allison asked quietly.

"Five more minutes," Claire said, checking her watch. "They said thirty minutes maximum before—"

Before she could finish, they heard it: movement from inside the lighthouse above them, not from below where Kate and Brian were exploring. Someone climbing the iron stairs toward the lamp room.

The distinctive clang of boots on metal spiraled down through the tower. Fast, confident steps.

"That's not Kate and Brian," Allison whispered. "They went down, not up."

Claire called into the lighthouse: "Who's there?"

The footsteps stopped. Then continued faster—someone running upward.

Allison moved, camera raised. Claire followed with her flashlight. The spiral stairs rose into shadow. The footsteps had stopped. Someone had reached the lamp room or was hiding.

"Brian? Kate?" Claire called down the stairs to the sub-level. No response. The stone swallowed sound.

She and Allison climbed. The iron stairs rang beneath their feet, announcing their presence to whoever waited above. At each landing, Claire swept her flashlight around—empty service rooms, storage spaces, nothing. But she could feel someone nearby. The air had that quality of occupied space, of breath and presence.

They reached the lamp room. The door stood open. Inside, the massive automated beacon rotated slowly, its mechanics humming steadily. And scratched into the metal door frame, fresh enough that metal shavings still clung to the grooves:

*LEAVE HER ALONE*

Done within the hour. Within the last thirty minutes, probably. While they'd all been focused on searching caves and sub-levels, he'd been here above them, leaving his warning.

Allison photographed the carving, her hands shaking slightly.

The lamp room had no other exits, no hiding places. Just the beacon machinery and windows overlooking the entire island. Through the glass, Claire could see the whole two acres spread below. The cottage, the equipment shed, the paths they walked. A keeper's view. A god's-eye perspective on his domain.

"He watches from here," Claire realized. "This is his command post. He tracks our movements, plans his next move."

They descended, checking each landing. At the base, they called to Kate and Brian. Faint response: "Coming up!"

Kate and Brian emerged from below, excited and disturbed.

"He's been living down there," Kate reported. "Not just hiding. Living. There's a chamber with evidence of habitation going back years. Bedding, supplies, personal effects. And Brian found something else."

Brian held up a leather-bound journal, water-stained and salt-damaged but intact. "His log. He's been keeping a lighthouse keeper's log. Just like the official ones from before automation."

They returned to the cottage to examine the journal in better light. Claire spread it open on the kitchen table while the team gathered around.

The handwriting was cramped and erratic, but legible. The first entry was dated February 1968—three months after Silas Grant's death.

*"Returned to my post today. The crossing was hard but she called me back. The light needs a keeper. Automation is a lie. The ships need human eyes, human judgment. I will keep the light. As I always have. As I always will."*

"He talks like he's Silas," Allison said. "Like he's been the keeper all along, like there was no gap, no death."

Brian flipped through pages. Entry after entry, spanning years. Daily logs of weather conditions, ship traffic observed (mostly imagined, Claire suspected), maintenance notes on the automated beacon, observations about the island's condition. It read like an official lighthouse keeper's log except for one thing: the increasing references to "the others."

An entry from 1972: *"The others visited last night. Showed me the hidden passages below the tide line. They understand. They served the light too. They know the sacrifice required."*

1976: *"Fourteen ships passed safely last night. The others helped me watch. We keep the light together. Living and dead, all servants of the beacon."*

1979: *"The Coast Guard came today. I hid. The others warned me they were coming. They see things I cannot. They are the light's eyes when I must rest."*

"He's completely dissociated from reality," Kate said. "Living in a fantasy where dead lighthouse keepers are helping him."

"Or," Allison said carefully, "he's experiencing something we don't understand."

"Don't start with ghosts," Kate warned.

"I'm talking about isolation psychosis. Fourteen years alone, barely any human contact—maybe 'the others' are hallucinations. The kind of phenomena that happen in extreme isolation."

Claire kept reading. The entries became more erratic in recent years. References to "invaders" and "threats to the light." In 1980, mention of a research team that came to study the island—clearly a previous expedition that had been driven away by similar sabotage.

Then, October 1981: *"They came again. Four of them. They want to measure the erosion. They want to declare her unsafe. They want to kill the light. I cannot allow this. Will not. The others agree. We must protect her."*

The subsequent entries detailed his campaign against Claire's team. Every act of sabotage documented like military operations. The drained generator. The contaminated water. The destroyed equipment. All planned, executed, logged with the precision of someone who'd been a keeper for decades.

"He's been studying us," Brian said, reading over Claire's shoulder. "Look—he's noted our routines, our habits, who does what work, how we react to each incident. This is psychological warfare."

The most recent entry was from this morning: *"The boat came. The fisherman who knew me before. He brought them supplies. They are fortifying. They will not leave easily. But I have time. I have patience. I have the light. And the light always wins."*

"Before," Kate repeated. "The fisherman who knew me before. He recognizes Frank. Remembers him from when Silas was alive."

"Or thinks he does," Claire countered. "Delusion can incorporate real memories, twist them, make them fit the false narrative."

A sound outside made them all freeze. Footsteps on gravel. Slow, deliberate, circling the cottage. The same pattern as the previous nights. Around and around, marking territory.

But this time, they were ready. Claire grabbed the flare gun. Kate had her wrench. Brian and Allison positioned themselves at windows. Frank, who'd been resting in the back bedroom, emerged with a boathook.

"On three," Claire said. "We go out together. We corner him. We end this."

"And if he fights?" Frank asked.

"Then we restrain him. Carefully. He's malnourished, elderly, probably physically weak despite everything. We have numbers and health on our side."

The footsteps circled. Came around to the front door.

Stopped.

"One," Claire counted. "Two. Three."

Kate yanked open the door. They flooded out, five people with weapons and flashlights, ready to confront—

Nothing.

The gravel path was empty. Fog swirled in the lighthouse beam. No one there.

But footprints. Fresh boot prints in a perfect circle around the cottage, still visible in the damp earth. And in the center of the circle, laid out deliberately on the path where they couldn't miss it:

A hand-carved wooden figurine. Crude but recognizable. A lighthouse, whittled from driftwood, painted white with what looked like ash or crushed shells.

And beneath it, scratched into the gravel:

*A GIFT FOR THE INVADERS*

*UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU THREATEN*

They stood in the cold and the fog, staring at the carved lighthouse. Claire picked it up carefully. It was well-made despite the crude materials. Someone had spent hours on this, shaping each detail. The tower, the lamp room, even the tiny windows carved into the wood.

"He's not just defending the lighthouse," Allison said quietly. "He loves it. This is... this is devotion."

"This is obsession," Kate corrected.

"Maybe they're the same thing," Allison replied.

They went back inside. Claire set the wooden lighthouse on the table next to the journal. Two artifacts from a mind that had been alone too long, that had poured all its love and fear and purpose into a building that couldn't love back.

"We're not equipped for this," Frank said finally. "This isn't research. This isn't even safety. This is... I don't know what this is, but it's beyond us."

"He's just a man," Kate insisted. "Disturbed, yes. Dangerous, possibly. But human. And humans can be reasoned with, captured, stopped."

"Can they?" Brian held up the journal. "Fourteen years he's been at this. Fourteen years of total dedication to a delusion. That's not someone you can just talk out of it."

Claire looked at the wooden lighthouse. At the journal. At her team, exhausted and frightened. At Frank, who'd known Silas Grant and still couldn't explain who was haunting this island.

"Tomorrow," she decided. "Tomorrow we make one more attempt at communication. Direct, clear, respectful. We explain that we're leaving, that we meant no harm, that the lighthouse is safe. If he accepts that, if he backs off, we leave peacefully. If not..."

"If not?" Brian asked.

"Then we activate the emergency beacon and let the authorities handle it. Because Frank's right. This is beyond us."

That night aboard Frank's boat, Claire dreamed of endless spiral stairs and beacons that never stopped. At the top, always, a figure keeping watch over empty seas.

She woke to grey dawn and Frank's radio crackling.

"—all vessels, be advised, storm system approaching from northeast, expected to reach coastal Maine by 1800 hours tomorrow. Seas building to eight to twelve feet, wind gusting to forty knots. Recommend all small craft seek harbor immediately—"

A storm. Twenty-four hours away. If they were going to make their final attempt at communication, it had to be today.

After that, the weather would decide for them whether they left or stayed.

And somewhere on the island, Claire knew, the keeper was listening to the same forecast. Preparing for the same storm. Getting ready to keep his light through the weather that had killed Silas Grant fourteen years ago.

History, Claire thought, had a way of repeating itself.

The only question was whether they'd be here to see it.
