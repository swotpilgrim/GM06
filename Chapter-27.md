# Chapter 27: The Journals Deciphered

The Coast Guard evidence room smelled like old paper and mildew. Brian sat at a metal table, forty-seven water-damaged journals spread before him, supervised by a bored petty officer who'd been told to ensure nothing went missing.

"Academic research," Brian had explained when requesting access. "My dissertation on lighthouse keeper psychology. These journals are primary sources—possibly the only documentation of fifteen-year isolation and mental deterioration. Historically invaluable."

Permission granted. Two days to read, catalog, photograph. Everything supervised, everything documented. Brian didn't mind. He would have read for a week if they'd let him.

He started chronologically. October 1966. Silas's handwriting was careful, controlled, each entry dated precisely.

*October 15, 1966: Received termination notice. Lighthouse to be automated by year's end. Twenty-one years of service. Dismissed like a hired hand. They don't understand. Machines can't keep the light. Only devotion keeps the light.*

*October 22, 1966: Met with Coast Guard personnel. Explained the necessity of human oversight. Automation will fail. Ships will crash. The rocks call to vessels and only I know how to answer. They dismissed my concerns. Called me obsessed. Don't they understand? This IS my life.*

Entry by entry, tracking the descent. Anguish at losing his purpose. Anger at being replaced by automated systems. Growing conviction that disaster would follow his removal. The language shifting from rational to desperate to unhinged.

*November 30, 1966: Removed from lighthouse premises. Forced evacuation. I told them. I TOLD them what would happen. The light needs a keeper. She'll fail without me. They'll realize their mistake when ships begin crashing. They'll beg me to return. I'll be ready.*

Brian photographed each page, took careful notes. This was psychiatric documentation in real time—watching a man lose his grip on reality, watching purpose and identity merge until separation was impossible.

The entries from 1967 showed Silas living rough on the mainland. Drinking, odd jobs, watching the lighthouse from shore every night.

*March 12, 1967: Watched her from the harbor. Automated beacon functioning. But it's not the same. No one tends her. No one cares. Just machinery, cold and indifferent. Ships pass safely but they don't understand how close they come. The rocks call and the light answers but there's no love in it. No devotion. Just mechanism.*

*July 8, 1967: Dreamed of the others last night. The previous keepers. The ones who drowned. They spoke to me. Said there's a way. Said death isn't the end for those who love the light enough. Said they're still there, still keeping watch, still serving. Maybe they're right. Maybe there's a way.*

Brian paused. Read that entry three times. The others. Already appearing in Silas's thoughts months before his drowning. Delusion forming early, or genuine experience? Impossible to tell from text alone.

The final entry before the drowning was dated November 18, 1967.

*I'm going back tonight. Storm building—reports say worst of the season. Perfect. They won't chase me in weather like this. I'll row to the island, resume my duties. If they try to remove me again, I'll resist. I'll die before I leave her a second time.*

*The others showed me in last night's dream. Showed me how they stayed. Said drowning isn't the end if you refuse to let go. Said the light holds those who serve it. Keeps them bound, keeps them animate, keeps them purposeful. They drowned but they stayed. I'll drown but I'll stay.*

*If they won't let me keep the light alive, I'll do it from the other side.*

*Storm won't stop me. Death won't stop me. Nothing will stop me.*

*I'm the keeper. I'll always be the keeper.*

*Always.*

The entry ended there. No signature. No closing. Just that final word: Always.

Brian's hands were shaking as he photographed the page.

Then a gap. Three months. November 18, 1967 through January 31, 1968. No entries. The pages were there—Brian counted them—but blank. As if Silas had kept the journal but written nothing. Or been unable to write. Or been dead.

February 1, 1968. New entry. Same handwriting but different quality—less controlled, more erratic, letters formed with difficulty like someone relearning motor skills.

*I stayed.*

*Drowning was real. Water in my lungs, heart stopped, body on rocks. I remember death. The cold. The dark. The absence.*

*But they were waiting. The others. In the water, in the darkness, between life and whatever comes next. They pulled me back. Not to life—to something else. Between. Sustained not by breath but by purpose. Bound not by flesh but by devotion.*

*The light holds us. We serve the light. I keep her now. Forever.*

*I'm the keeper. Dead but not gone. Drowned but not finished. Serving eternally.*

*This is what I wanted. This is what I am.*

*Forever.*

Brian photographed it, logged it, tried to maintain academic objectivity. But his stomach was tight. Whether delusion or truth, this was a man describing his own death and return with complete conviction.

Subsequent entries—1968, 1969, 1970s—documented Silas's spectral existence. Minimal food (fish, seabirds, scavenged supplies). Reduced need for warmth (survived Maine winters that should have killed him). Aging slower than biology allowed.

The language changed too. First-person pronouns fading. "I" becoming "the keeper." Identity dissolving into function.

*The keeper maintains the automated systems. The keeper watches for ships. The keeper answers the rocks' calling. The keeper serves the light. The keeper is the light. The keeper eternal.*

But the most disturbing discovery came in the later journals.

Brian was reading a 1974 entry when he noticed it. Handwriting in the margin. Not Silas's careful script. Different hand entirely—older style, copperplate from an earlier era.

*Well done, brother. You learn quickly. The binding strengthens with devotion. Soon you'll need nothing but purpose.*

Signed: *J. Whitmore*

Brian flipped back, found more. Different entries, different years, different handwriting. Margin notes offering advice, encouragement, warnings. Multiple hands. Multiple eras.

A 1977 entry about surviving winter cold had a margin note in tight, cramped script:

*The cold cannot touch those who serve. The light warms from within. Trust in your purpose.*

Signed: *R. Patterson 1907*

A 1980 entry about ships passing at night had flowing cursive in the margin:

*You feel them, yes? Their need for guidance. This is why we stay. This is why we serve. Forever vigilant.*

Signed: *Edmund Cross 1891*

Brian photographed every margin note, pulse racing. Seven different hands across different journals. Names that matched—he checked his historical research—documented lighthouse keepers from Whitmore Point's history. All drowned. All supposedly dead.

The latest margin note was dated October 1981. Just before the research team arrived.

Silas's entry: *Researchers coming. They will study the island, study erosion, study danger. They will recommend the light be decommissioned. I must stop them. I must protect her.*

Margin note in shaky, ancient script:

*Protect what we have built. The light must continue. If they threaten her, do what you must. We will help. We are always here.*

Signed: *J. Whitmore 1883*

The first keeper. The original. Dead for ninety-eight years, supposedly, but writing margin notes in modern journals.

Brian gathered his photographs, notes, evidence. Found Claire at the motel.

"I need you to see this."

He spread the photographs across the bed. Showed her the progression: the drowning entry, the gap, the return, the dissociative language shift. And finally, the margin notes.

"Seven different hands," Brian said. "I compared them to historical documents—old lighthouse logs, keeper signatures from personnel files. The handwriting matches. J. Whitmore's margin notes match his 1883 keeper logs exactly. Same distinctive copperplate, same letter formation. Either Silas practiced for years to forge historical hands perfectly, or—"

"Or what?" Claire's voice was flat.

"Or he was really communicating with them. The others. The previous dead keepers. They were writing in his journals. Offering guidance. Teaching him how to stay dead and keep serving."

Claire examined the photographs. The handwriting was different—no question. Multiple hands, multiple styles, separated by decades. Margin notes offering advice about serving the light, surviving death, maintaining eternal vigilance.

"Forgery," she said. "He researched the previous keepers, practiced their handwriting, created an elaborate delusion-support system. Made his ghost story tangible through written evidence."

"For fifteen years? Writing in different hands, maintaining consistent historical accuracy, never breaking character?"

"People maintain delusions for lifetimes. This is just more elaborate than most."

"Or," Brian said quietly, "the others are real. Were real. Are real. The previous keepers who drowned and stayed. Writing margin notes because they exist in some form. Guiding Silas because they did the same thing decades earlier. The lighthouse binds them, holds them, keeps them serving forever."

Claire wanted to dismiss it. Wanted to say impossible, delusion, psychotic break. But she'd heard the footsteps in the lighthouse. Multiple sets, different rhythms, climbing stairs when they were alone. She'd seen the wet footprints from the locked door. She'd watched Silas's certainty, his detailed knowledge, his impossible survival.

"I don't know," she said finally. "I don't know if it matters. Real or delusion, the result is the same: Silas Grant exists in a state that shouldn't be possible. Whether supported by ghosts or psychosis, he's something we can't explain."

"The scientific method requires we consider all evidence."

"The scientific method requires repeatable observation and testable hypotheses. This is neither." Claire gathered the photographs. "Document it. Include it in your dissertation. Let peer review decide. But don't ask me to believe in ghosts writing margin notes. I can't. I won't."

But her voice lacked conviction. And when Brian left, she sat alone with the photographs, staring at handwriting from seven different eras, seven different men, all supposedly drowned, all supposedly dead.

All supposedly serving a lighthouse that bound them beyond death.

The exhumation was scheduled for tomorrow. They'd open plot 127, see what remained of the body buried in 1967, maybe get DNA to compare with the living prisoner.

Maybe get answers. Maybe get more questions.

Claire put the photographs away, tried to sleep, and dreamed of footsteps climbing endless stairs.

Tomorrow they'd dig up a grave and see if dead men could be in two places at once.

Tomorrow they'd learn if impossible was just another word for unexplained.

Tomorrow.

Always tomorrow.

Always.
