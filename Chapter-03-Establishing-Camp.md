# Chapter 3: Establishing Camp

Morning came grey and cold, fog thick as ever. Claire woke to waves and distant gulls, disoriented before remembering. The keeper's cottage. Whitmore Point. Someone living here who shouldn't be.

She sat up, back protesting against the iron bedstead. Through the salt-streaked window, the lighthouse rose into fog, its beam still rotating. Automated. Mechanical. Indifferent.

Downstairs, Kate stood at the kitchen window with coffee.

"Quiet night after the foghorn," Kate said. "Nothing on my watch."

"Good." Claire poured coffee. Strong and bitter, but hot. "Let's get to work. We've got seven days of research, and I'd rather not waste them jumping at shadows."

"You think that's what we're doing?"

"I think we found evidence someone's been using this cottage. We'll look for them. But we also have a job to do."

Kate nodded. "What's the plan?"

Claire pulled out her yellow legal pad, already covered in notes. "We start the actual research. I want to establish baseline data while we search. Kate, you set up the surveying equipment on the western cliff—get initial erosion measurements. Brian, you document the lighthouse interior for your thesis. Allison, you photograph the island's current state. I'll do geological mapping and keep watch from high ground."

"Splitting up?" Kate raised an eyebrow.

"Working in visible range of each other. The island's only two acres. We stay where we can see at least one other person at all times."

Brian emerged from his bedroom, rumpled and exhausted. "Did I hear a work plan? I am very ready to not think about footsteps and mysterious beds."

Allison came down last, quiet, camera already around her neck. She looked like she hadn't slept.

They ate quick breakfast—instant oatmeal and coffee—and divided equipment. Kate loaded her tool belt. Brian packed film and his recorder. Allison checked her light meter. Claire filled her geology kit.

By eight they were outside, fog swirling like something alive.

"Western cliff," Kate announced, hoisting her equipment case. "I'll be the one not falling to my death."

"Lighthouse interior," Brian said, looking up at the tower with barely contained excitement. "I'll try not to get lost in a sixty-five-foot-tall building."

"I'm doing a full circuit photography survey," Allison said. "Starting at the northern point, working clockwise."

Claire nodded. "I'll be mapping from the central high ground. Everyone checks in verbally every thirty minutes. Shout loud—fog kills sound. If you find anything unusual, call out immediately. Clear?"

A chorus of agreements, and they dispersed into the fog.

Claire climbed to the highest point—a granite outcrop fifteen feet above the lighthouse. From here, she could see vague shapes of her team through the grey. Kate's orange vest near the cliff. Brian disappearing into the lighthouse. Allison moving along the northern rocks.

She began documenting. Granite bedrock, Devonian age, heavily weathered. She took samples, made measurements, sketched formations. Good, solid, normal work.

But she couldn't shake the feeling of being watched.

Twenty minutes in, Kate's voice cut through the fog. "Claire! You there?"

"Here! What is it?"

"Equipment shed. Lock's been tampered with."

Claire scrambled down from her perch and jogged toward the shed. Kate stood by the door, examining the padlock.

"Look." Kate pointed to fresh scratches around the keyhole. "Someone tried to pick this. Recently—the metal's still bright, not oxidized."

Claire studied the marks. Definite tool marks, precise attempts. "Did they get in?"

"No. Lock's still secure. But they tried hard." Kate rattled the door. "Why?"

Through the window, Claire saw maintenance equipment, fuel drums, spare parts. "Tools, maybe. Fuel."

"Or checking what we have access to." Kate's expression was grim. "Reconnaissance."

The word hung between them. Not squatter. Not drifter. Reconnaissance meant planning, strategy, threat assessment.

"Keep working," Claire said. "But stay alert."

Kate nodded and headed back toward the cliff with her equipment. Claire returned to her outcrop, but her focus was shot. She kept scanning the fog, looking for movement that wasn't her team.

Thirty minutes later, Brian's voice echoed from the lighthouse. "Claire! This is amazing! You have to see this!"

She could hear the enthusiasm even through the fog. She smiled despite herself and headed for the lighthouse.

Inside, the air was cooler, thick with the smell of machine oil and salt. The spiral iron staircase rose into darkness above. Brian stood on the landing halfway up, his flashlight illuminating something on the wall.

"Look at this!" He gestured to a series of brass plaques mounted on the stone. "Keeper dedication plates. Every man who tended this light from 1883 to automation. History right here on the wall."

Claire climbed up beside him. The plaques were tarnished but readable. Names and dates etched in brass. Thom

as Morrison, 1883-1887. James Whelan, 1887-1893. On down through the decades, a roster of men who'd kept this light burning.

The last plaque read: Silas Grant, 1945-1966.

"Twenty-one years," Brian said softly. "Longer than any other keeper. He must have loved this place."

Claire touched the brass plate. Silas Grant. The name from Frank's story, from the historical records Brian had been reading. Drowned in 1967. Dead fourteen years.

"Keep documenting," she said. "But Brian—stay sharp, okay?"

His enthusiasm dimmed a little. "You think someone's really here."

"I think we don't know what's going on yet. So we stay careful."

She left him to his work and emerged back into the fog. The lighthouse beam swept overhead, visible as a diffuse glow through the murk.

Allison appeared out of the grey like a ghost, camera in hand. "Claire. I need to show you something."

They walked to the eastern shore where tide pools dotted the rocks. Allison had been taking systematic photographs of the island's features, documenting everything for the research grant.

"I took a shot of this area forty minutes ago," Allison said, gesturing to a cluster of rocks near a tide pool. "Then I moved on, did the northern circuit, came back. I wanted a different angle for the light."

She showed Claire two developed Polaroids—she'd been using instant film for quick reference shots. Both images showed the same location. But in the first photo, a piece of driftwood lay across the rocks in one position. In the second photo, taken from a slightly different angle forty minutes later, the driftwood had moved. Not shifted by wind or tide—moved deliberately, placed at a different angle.

"Could be wind," Claire offered.

"It's a six-foot piece of driftwood, water-logged, probably weighs forty pounds." Allison's voice was quiet but certain. "Wind didn't move it. Someone did."

Claire stared at the photographs. The evidence was clear. Between Allison's two shots, someone had moved that driftwood. Someone had been here, in this spot, while they were all working.

"Where's the actual driftwood now?" Claire asked.

They walked to the rocks. The driftwood lay exactly as shown in the second photograph. But as they approached, Claire noticed something else: footprints in the mud between the rocks. Adult-sized, boot prints, fresh enough that they hadn't yet been washed away by spray from the tide pools.

The prints led to the water's edge and vanished.

"He walked into the water," Allison whispered.

Or into the tide caves, Claire thought, remembering the dark openings she'd noticed yesterday. The island had hidden spaces. Places someone could move unseen, appearing and disappearing like a ghost.

They gathered for lunch at the cottage. Claire laid out their findings: the lock-picking attempt, the moved driftwood, the footprints.

"He's watching us," Kate said. "Moving around while we work. Testing our security."

"We need to search the caves," Brian said. "If he's hiding—"

"At low tide," Kate interrupted. "Those caves flood. Wrong time, we drown."

Claire checked the tide chart. "Low tide 10:47 AM tomorrow. We search then. For now, pairs only. No one alone."

They ate canned soup in silence. The lighthouse beam swept past, regular as a heartbeat.

That afternoon, Claire and Kate worked together on the western cliff, taking measurements and samples. Brian and Allison documented the lighthouse and cottage. Twice, Claire thought she saw movement in the rocks below the cliff. Both times, when she looked directly, there was nothing.

As evening fell, they retreated to the cottage. Kate cooked dinner on the propane stove—canned stew and bread, simple but hot. They ate listening to the wind pick up outside, the fog pressing against the windows.

The lighthouse beam swept. Darkness, then light, then darkness.

"So," Brian said finally. "Who wants to admit they're completely creeped out?"

Despite everything, Claire laughed. "I think we can all admit that."

"I'm not creeped out," Kate said. "I'm pissed off. Someone's playing games with us, trying to scare us off. Well, it's not working."

"Brave words," Allison said softly. "But what if he's not trying to scare us away? What if he's just... protecting something?"

"The lighthouse," Brian said. "Like Silas Grant. That's what the records said—delusional attachment to the lighthouse. Believed it needed him."

Claire set down her spoon. "Silas Grant is dead."

"I know. I'm just saying—what if our squatter has the same delusion? What if he thinks he's protecting the light?"

The conversation died. Outside, the wind howled. The cottage creaked.

At ten PM, they heard it again: footsteps on gravel. Slow, deliberate, circling the cottage. They froze, listening. The steps continued for perhaps thirty seconds, then stopped directly outside the kitchen window.

Silence.

Kate grabbed her flashlight and stood. "That's it. I'm done with this."

She strode to the window and yanked aside the curtain, flashlight beam cutting through the glass into fog. Nothing. Just rocks and grass and the lighthouse beam sweeping past.

But when they checked in the morning, they found fresh boot prints in a complete circle around the cottage. Someone had walked around and around the building while they sat inside, marking territory, demonstrating that locked doors meant nothing.

The message was clear: *I can reach you whenever I want.*

And sometime during the night, while they huddled in the cottage, the foghorn had sounded at odd intervals. Not its normal pattern. Three long blasts, then silence. Then two short blasts. Then one long.

Like someone was playing with it. Learning how it worked. Making it speak.
