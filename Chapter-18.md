# Chapter 18: The Hunt

The photograph was perfect.

Brian spread it across the table—the print Allison had developed in the cottage's makeshift darkroom, chemicals still drying. Silas Grant in sharp focus, twenty feet from the camera, fog swirling around him like something summoned from the deep. Every detail visible: the matted white hair, the ruined clothing, the bare feet on granite. Most importantly, his face. Gaunt and weathered, but clear enough for identification. Clear enough to prove he existed.

"That's him," Kate said quietly, studying the image. "That's our ghost."

"Not a ghost." Claire leaned over the photo, analytical. "A man. Severely malnourished, probably hypothermic, definitely psychotic. But flesh and blood."

"Flesh and blood that threatened to kill us." Allison wrapped her hands around a mug of instant coffee, still shaking from the encounter. "He meant it. When he said he'd protect the lighthouse—he meant he'd do anything."

Brian looked up from his notes. "Frank's not due back for two more days. Forty-eight hours minimum, possibly longer if weather delays him."

"We can't wait that long." Kate pushed away from the table, pacing. "Not after this. He's escalating. First sabotage, then stalking, now direct threats. Next time he won't just talk."

"What do you propose?" Claire asked.

Kate stopped pacing, turned to face the group. "We use the lighthouse against him. The beacon's automated, right? It's a navigational aid. If it fails, Coast Guard has to investigate—maritime safety protocol. They'll dispatch a boat within hours."

"Disable the beacon." Claire nodded slowly. "Force a malfunction."

"Exactly. We access the lamp room, smash the control panel, kill the light. Coast Guard notices, comes to repair it, finds us and our friend." Kate looked at each of them. "We trigger our own rescue."

Brian frowned. "But if we damage the lighthouse, he'll—"

"He'll lose his mind, yeah." Kate's voice was hard. "But we'll be ready for him. And it gets us off this rock by tomorrow morning instead of waiting two more days for him to make good on his threat."

Allison set down her mug. "He won't let us near the lighthouse. Not now. Not after I told him what we were studying."

"Then we go ready for confrontation." Kate crossed to where she'd laid out her tools—wrenches, pry bars, equipment from the research kit. "Two people go up, two stay as backup. We're faster than him, younger, better fed. We can outrun an old man if we have to."

"Or we can try to subdue him," Claire said. "Restrain him until Coast Guard arrives. He's clearly suffering from exposure and malnutrition. He needs medical help."

Kate's look was skeptical. "You want to have a compassionate intervention with the guy who's been terrorizing us?"

"I want to end this without anyone getting hurt." Claire met her gaze. "Including him. He's a victim too—of isolation, mental illness, whatever happened to him. We're not executioners."

"We're not martyrs either."

"No." Claire stood, decision made. "We're researchers who are going to signal for help and bring an end to this situation. Kate and I will access the lamp room and disable the beacon. Brian and Allison, you stay here, ready to call for help if—"

"No." Allison stood too. "I'm coming. You might need the camera flash again. It worked before."

"Allison—"

"I made contact with him. He knows me. If we have to talk him down, I might be able to." Her voice was steadier now, fear transforming into determination. "I'm coming."

Claire looked at Brian. "You stay here. If we're not back in an hour, or if you hear anything that sounds like trouble—"

"I'll do what exactly?" Brian gestured at the broken radio. "We have no communication."

"Use flares. We still have the emergency kit from the boat." Kate was already gathering tools, selecting what she needed. "Three flares, fire them off the western cliff. That's the universal distress signal. Someone will see."

"In this fog?" Brian looked doubtful.

"Then you come help us. But you stay here unless things go wrong. Understood?"

Brian nodded reluctantly. "Understood."

They armed themselves with what they had: Kate took a heavy wrench and pry bar, Claire carried a flashlight and Brian's camera bag full of rocks (improvised weapon), Allison kept her camera with fresh flash bulbs. Not much against a man defending his obsession, but better than nothing.

"Stay together," Claire said as they prepared to leave. "No one breaks formation. We go to the lighthouse, we access the lamp room, we disable the beacon. If he confronts us, we try to talk first. If he attacks, we defend ourselves and retreat. Clear?"

"Clear," Kate and Allison answered together.

Brian watched from the doorway as they crossed the open ground toward the lighthouse. Fog still hung thick, visibility poor, the white tower emerging from grey like a ghost ship. Fifty yards felt like a mile. Allison's heart hammered. Kate moved with military precision, wrench ready. Claire walked with forced calm, leadership holding her spine straight.

They reached the lighthouse base. The heavy door stood closed but not locked—it never locked, remnant of Coast Guard regulations about emergency access. Kate reached for the handle.

"Wait." Allison grabbed her arm, pointing.

Fresh scratches around the door frame. Recent, within the last hour. Someone had been here, marking the entrance, maybe preparing defenses.

Kate met Claire's eyes. Claire nodded. They'd come this far.

Kate pulled the door open.

Silas Grant stood in the darkness beyond, piece of driftwood raised like a club, eyes wild.

"NO!"

He charged before they could react. Kate barely got the wrench up in time to deflect the driftwood as it swung toward her head. The impact jarred her arms, sent her stumbling backward. Silas pressed forward with strength that shouldn't exist in that emaciated frame—adrenaline or madness or something else entirely.

"You can't hurt her!" Silas screamed, voice raw. "Leave the light alone!"

Claire tried to circle behind but the doorway was too narrow. Silas and Kate grappled, his driftwood club against her wrench, both trying to gain leverage. He was stronger than he looked, wiry and desperate, fighting for the only thing that mattered to him.

Brian ran from the cottage, saw the confrontation, sprinted to help. He grabbed Silas from behind, trying to pull him off Kate, got an elbow to the face for his trouble. Pain exploded in his shoulder where the blow landed. He staggered, tasting blood.

Claire tackled Silas from the side, her full weight hitting his ribs. They went down together, a tangle of limbs and fury. Silas thrashed, surprisingly strong, kicking and clawing. Kate dove in, trying to pin his arms.

Allison stood frozen for one precious second, then remembered. The camera flash.

She raised it, aimed at the struggling mass, pressed the trigger. White light exploded, flashbulb igniting with magnesium brilliance. Silas shrieked, recoiled from the light like a vampire in old movies, hands flying up to cover his eyes.

"Again!" Kate yelled.

Allison hit the flash twice more in rapid succession. Strobe-light disorientation, white afterimages, Silas stumbling backward into the lighthouse, blinded and panicking.

"Inside!" Claire was up, pushing forward. They poured through the door, pursuing him into darkness. The lighthouse interior swallowed them—stone walls, spiral iron stairs, shadows and echoes.

Silas recovered faster than expected. He fled upward, bare feet on iron steps, the distinctive clang-clang-clang of his flight spiraling up through the tower. Kate went after him immediately, wrench in hand. Claire followed. Allison came last, Brian limping behind, shoulder throbbing.

The spiral staircase was claustrophobic nightmare—narrow, steep, iron treads worn smooth by decades of keepers climbing to tend the light. Up and up and up, the spiral making them dizzy, Silas somewhere above, his footsteps echoing weirdly in the enclosed space.

Something clattered down from above—a piece of metal, a broken mechanism. Kate dodged, nearly fell backward into Claire. Another piece, deliberately thrown. Silas was weaponizing the lighthouse itself.

"Keep going!" Kate shouted, pressing upward.

They climbed through levels: the base storage room, the service level, the mechanism room with its automated turning gears. Each landing offered Silas a chance to throw debris, to slow pursuit. He knew every inch of this tower, every shadow, every hiding place.

But they were younger, stronger, better fed. The gap closed. Allison could hear his ragged breathing now, harsh gasps echoing down the stairwell. He was flagging, exhaustion claiming him.

One more level. The stairs opened into the lamp room.

Silas stood at the top, silhouetted against the glass enclosure housing the massive beacon. Cornered. Desperate. The driftwood club raised again, ready to defend his purpose to the death.

"Please," he gasped, voice breaking. "Please don't hurt her. She needs the light. Ships need her. I keep her safe. I keep them all safe."

Kate raised the wrench. Claire held up a hand, stopping her.

"Silas," Claire said, breathing hard from the climb. "We're not here to hurt the lighthouse. We're here to help you. You're sick. You need medical care. You need—"

"I need to keep the light!" His voice cracked. "That's all I need! That's all I am!"

He backed against the beacon housing, trapped between them and the only thing he loved. His eyes darted from face to face—Kate's hard determination, Claire's sympathetic firmness, Allison's camera ready for another flash, Brian bleeding and frightened in the rear.

No escape. No way out except through them.

Silas Grant, keeper of Whitmore Point Light, made his choice.

He bolted for the exterior door, the one leading to the catwalk that circled the lamp room sixty-five feet above the rocks.

"Don't!" Claire lunged for him but he was faster, driven by panic and desperate knowledge of the space.

The door slammed open. Wind and fog poured in. Silas vanished onto the narrow metal walkway that ringed the tower's peak.

Kate swore and followed. Claire was right behind her. Allison hesitated—heights terrified her—but the camera had to document this. She stepped through the door onto the catwalk.

Wind hit like a fist. Fog swirled. The metal walkway was barely three feet wide, railing on one side, glass lamp housing on the other, and sixty-five feet of empty air to unforgiving rocks below.

Silas moved along the rail like he'd done it a thousand times—because he had. This was his domain, his territory, the place he'd circled endlessly through fifteen years of lonely vigil.

They were in his world now.

And he had nowhere left to run.
