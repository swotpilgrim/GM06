# Chapter 8: Frank's Testimony

Before they activated the emergency beacon, Claire insisted on one more review of what they knew. If they were going to call for rescue, abandoning the research and admitting defeat, she wanted to be absolutely certain there wasn't another option.

They sat in the fortified cottage, documents spread across the table. Brian had organized everything chronologically: Silas Grant's personnel file, the termination records, the post-1966 sightings, and finally the death certificate and funeral notice.

"Walk me through it again," Claire said. "Everything about the drowning."

Brian read from the newspaper clipping. "November 17th, 1967. Silas takes a boat from Boothbay Harbor marina during storm warnings. Multiple witnesses. Coast Guard is alerted but can't locate him in bad weather. Boat found capsized near Whitmore Point the next morning. Body recovered three days later—November 20th."

"And Frank Garrison was one of the witnesses," Kate added. "Says so right there in the article."

"Not just a witness," Brian corrected. "Frank was at the funeral. Look." He showed them the photograph again—grainy, black and white, a dozen people around a casket. Frank in the back row, younger but recognizable.

Claire studied the image. Fourteen years ago, Frank would have been in his mid-forties. Still fishing these waters, part of the tight-knit coastal community. If Silas Grant's body was recovered and buried, Frank would have known. Would have seen.

"The funeral was November 23rd," Brian continued. "Coastal Baptist Church. Burial at Evergreen Cemetery. Death certificate lists cause as accidental drowning, confirmed by medical examiner. Silas Grant, age sixty-one, no surviving family."

"So the official record is clear," Claire said. "Silas drowned. Was buried. Is dead."

"Unless the body wasn't his," Allison said quietly. "Unless someone made a mistake."

"Dental records don't make mistakes," Kate countered. "Neither do personal effects. If they identified the body as Silas, they had reasons."

"Or," Brian said slowly, "the man we met in the caves isn't Silas. He just thinks he is."

That was the question that kept circling back. Identity. Who was the figure living in the caves? A copycat, someone who'd read about Silas and absorbed his delusions? A relative? Someone who'd worked with Silas and internalized his obsession?

"Frank would know," Claire said. "Frank knew Silas personally. Saw him during those final months. Saw the body after it was recovered. He's the only person who can tell us if the man on this island could possibly be Silas Grant."

"Frank won't be back for four days," Kate reminded her.

"I know." Claire looked at the emergency beacon. "But if we're going to activate this, if we're calling for evacuation, I want to understand what we're evacuating from. Not just a dangerous drifter. Maybe something else entirely."

They spent the morning reviewing every document Brian had found. Silas's maintenance logs from his keeper years showed meticulous attention to detail, precise record-keeping, professional competence. No sign of mental illness until 1960, when subtle changes appeared in the handwriting and language.

By 1965, the logs were clearly disturbed. References to "she" and "her" when describing the lighthouse. Anthropomorphizing the structure, treating it as a living thing. By 1966, just before termination, Silas was writing entries like: "She whispered to me last night. The ships are coming. I must be ready. She depends on me. Without me, she is just stone and light. With me, she lives."

"That's not just obsession," Allison said. "That's full delusional disorder. He thought the lighthouse was alive and needed him specifically to function."

"And when they took that away," Brian added, "they took his entire reason for existence."

Claire thought about the man in the cave. The carved message: *I'm the keeper. Always was. Always will be.* The coordinates recited in darkness. The carved memorial: *STILL KEEP THE LIGHT 1967-.*

Whoever he was, he shared Silas's delusion. Maybe was Silas. Maybe had become Silas.

At noon, they heard engines.

Everyone froze. Kate moved to the window, peering through cracks in the boards. "Boat. Coming this way."

Claire's heart leaped. "Frank? Early?"

"Too small for Frank's trawler. Looks like... Coast Guard patrol boat."

They scrambled outside, watching as a white Coast Guard vessel approached the island. How? They hadn't activated the beacon. The radio was destroyed. How did the Coast Guard know to come?

The boat anchored offshore. Two officers in a small motor launch headed for the dock. Claire and her team rushed down to meet them.

The officers were professional, efficient. Lieutenant Chen, mid-thirties, and Seaman Rodriguez, maybe twenty-five. They stepped onto the dock with the easy competence of people who did this regularly.

"Dr. Ashford?" Chen asked. "We received a distress call from this location yesterday. Is your team all right?"

"Distress call?" Claire was confused. "We didn't— The radio's been destroyed."

"Our records show a mayday was transmitted from Whitmore Point Lighthouse at 0317 hours yesterday morning on emergency channel sixteen. Then canceled at 0323. We tried to follow up but got no response. Weather delayed us, so we're checking now."

Claire felt cold. The radio log entry she'd found yesterday morning. 0317 hours. Someone had used their radio to call the Coast Guard, then canceled before help arrived.

Not to summon rescue. To test if the Coast Guard was monitoring. To see how quickly they'd respond.

And now they were here. Because of a false alarm.

"There's been... a situation," Claire began. She explained quickly: the stalker, the sabotage, the man in the caves who believed he was the lighthouse keeper. The destroyed equipment, the contaminated supplies, the systematic elimination of their resources.

Chen and Rodriguez exchanged glances. Chen pulled out a radio. "We should report this. Get backup out here, conduct a proper search."

"Wait," Kate said. "There's something else. The man we encountered—he may be Silas Grant. The former keeper who supposedly drowned in 1967."

Chen's expression shifted from concern to skepticism. "Silas Grant's been dead fourteen years. We have records."

"We know. But this man believes he's Silas. Or maybe is Silas. We don't know." Claire heard how crazy it sounded. "Frank Garrison was at the funeral. He saw the body. He could identify whether this person could be the same man."

"Frank Garrison?" Rodriguez spoke for the first time. "The fisherman from Boothbay?"

"You know him?" Brian asked.

"Everyone knows Frank. Old-timer, been fishing these waters forever." Rodriguez paused. "He's the one who found Silas Grant's body in '67. Did the initial recovery before we arrived."

The information settled over them like fog. Frank hadn't just attended the funeral. Frank had found the body. Had pulled Silas Grant from the water himself.

"We need to speak to Frank," Claire said. "Before we do anything else. He's supposed to pick us up in four days, but if we could contact him sooner—"

Chen was already on his radio, calling the Coast Guard station. A brief conversation, then: "Frank's out on a fishing run. Won't be back to port until tomorrow evening. We can ask him to come out here after that."

"Two days," Claire calculated. "We can hold out two days."

Chen looked around the island, at the boarded cottage, the destroyed equipment shed. "Ma'am, with all due respect, we should evacuate you now. If there's a dangerous individual on this island—"

"He's not trying to kill us," Claire interrupted. "He's trying to protect the lighthouse. As long as we don't threaten it, he's just trying to scare us away. We've made it three days. We can make it two more."

"I don't recommend—"

"It's our choice," Kate said firmly. "We're staying."

Chen clearly didn't like it. But they couldn't force an evacuation if the team refused. "All right. We'll do a perimeter search of the island, see if we can locate this individual. If we find him, we'll take him into custody. If not, we'll post someone here overnight for your protection."

"Don't," Claire said. "If you post guards, he'll just hide. He knows every cave, every hidden space. He'll wait you out. But if it's just us, he might... communicate. Escalate. Give us information."

"You want him to escalate?" Rodriguez looked incredulous.

"We want answers," Claire said. "And Frank Garrison is the only person who can give them to us."

The Coast Guard officers conducted their search. Two hours of methodical exploration, checking caves at low tide, examining the lighthouse, searching the cottage and outbuildings. They found evidence—the carved messages, the disturbed food supplies, footprints—but no person.

"He's here," Chen said finally. "Somewhere. But we're not equipped for an extended manhunt on a two-acre island with cave systems and hiding spots. We'd need specialized personnel."

"In two days, Frank comes," Claire said. "Frank talks to us. Then we decide next steps."

Chen left them with emergency supplies—fresh water, MREs, new batteries for flashlights, and a satellite phone. "This works regardless of antenna damage. You have trouble, you call. We'll be here in ninety minutes."

"Thank you," Claire said.

After the Coast Guard boat departed, the team stood on the dock watching it disappear into fog.

"Two more days," Brian said. "Then we get answers."

"Or confirmation that we're dealing with a ghost," Allison added.

Kate snorted. "I don't believe in ghosts."

"Neither did I," Allison said. "But I'm starting to reconsider."

They returned to the cottage. Two more days. Forty-eight hours. Then Frank would come, and Frank would tell them what he saw when he pulled Silas Grant's body from the water fourteen years ago.

And maybe—just maybe—they'd understand what was really hunting them on this island.

That night, Claire sat by the window, watching the lighthouse beam sweep through fog. Fifteen seconds of light. Fifteen seconds of darkness. Over and over, mechanical and eternal.

Somewhere in that darkness, a man kept watch. Reciting coordinates. Protecting what he believed was alive. Maintaining a vigil that had lasted fourteen years or fourteen days or fourteen decades—time had no meaning in delusion.

Two more days.

They could survive two more days.

They had to.
