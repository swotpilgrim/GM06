# Chapter 9: Ghost or Madman

The debate started at the lighthouse base, standing over the carved memorial. Frank Garrison stared at the words etched in stone—*STILL KEEP THE LIGHT 1967-*—and his weathered face had gone pale.

"This is his handwriting," Frank said again, touching the letters. "Silas's. I'd recognize it anywhere."

"But you buried him," Kate insisted. "You pulled his body from the water yourself."

"I did." Frank's voice was hollow. "I know what I saw."

Claire stepped between them. "Let's approach this logically. We have two possibilities: either the body you recovered wasn't Silas Grant, or the person on this island isn't Silas Grant. One or the other has to be true."

"Unless you believe in ghosts," Allison said quietly.

"I don't," Kate snapped.

"Neither do I," Frank said. "But I also don't know how to explain this."

They moved to the caves. Brian led the way, showing Frank the tally marks, the salvaged supplies, the evidence of years—decades—of habitation. Frank examined everything with growing unease.

In the deepest chamber, where Brian and Allison had encountered the figure, Frank knelt by the carved messages in the wall. His fingers traced the letters.

"Silas carved like this," he murmured. "Same pressure, same angle. He was left-handed—you can see it in how the letters slope." He looked up at them. "Whoever's doing this either IS Silas, or studied him so closely they can replicate even his muscle memory."

"Is that possible?" Brian asked. "To copy someone that precisely?"

"I don't know," Frank admitted. "I'm a fisherman, not a detective."

Claire led them to the supply cache. Cans from the 1970s, rusted fishing gear, rot

ted blankets. "This has been here since just after Silas's death. Someone moved in immediately. November 1967, Silas drowns. December 1967, or early 1968, someone starts living here. Keeping the vigil Silas couldn't."

"A follower," Kate suggested. "Someone who admired Silas's dedication. Maybe another keeper who'd gone through the same isolation, understood the same obsession."

Brian shook his head. "Silas's records say he was the last keeper before automation. Every lighthouse on the Maine coast went automated between '62 and '66. There were no other keepers to follow his example."

"Then family," Kate tried. "Brother, cousin, someone who shared his delusions."

"Only child," Brian countered. "No siblings. No close relatives."

The silence stretched. Every rational explanation bumped against the facts. Someone with Silas's handwriting, his mannerisms, his obsession, living in his caves, maintaining his watch—for fourteen years.

Frank sat heavily on a rock. "I need to tell you something. Something I didn't mention before."

They waited.

"When I pulled Silas's body from the water," Frank began slowly, "it was in bad shape. Three days in cold November seas. Face was... damaged. Bloated. Unrecognizable."

"But you identified him," Claire said.

"Based on the body type. The clothes. The personal effects." Frank met her eyes. "The dental records confirmed it later. But at the scene, on my boat? I couldn't have sworn it was Silas based on appearance alone. I identified him because of context. Who else would it be? Who else would drown trying to reach this lighthouse during a storm?"

"So there's doubt," Kate said. "The visual ID wasn't certain."

"The forensics was certain," Frank countered. "Medical examiner, dental records, personal effects—all confirmed Silas Grant. I'm just saying that I, personally, couldn't have identified him by looking at his face."

Brian was already flipping through his notes. "Dental records. Who provided them? Where did they come from?"

"Coast Guard files," Frank said. "From Silas's personnel record. They'd have been taken when he was first appointed keeper, back in 1945."

"Thirty-six years before his death," Brian said. "Teeth change. Dental work gets done. What if the records were outdated? What if there was a mistake?"

"That's a lot of ifs," Kate said.

"But possible," Claire admitted. "Human error happens. Records get mismatched. If someone wanted to fake a death, and they had access to personnel files, they could potentially—"

"No." Frank stood up. "I know what you're thinking. That Silas faked his death, planted another body, used his own dental records to make the ID stick. But that doesn't work. Where would he get a body? How would he have the expertise to pull off that kind of deception?"

"Desperate people do impossible things," Allison said softly.

They climbed back to the surface. The afternoon was fading, grey light dimming toward evening. Frank checked his watch.

"I was supposed to pick you up and leave today," he said. "That was the plan. One week, then extraction."

"We can't leave without answers," Claire said.

"Can't we?" Frank looked at her seriously. "Claire, whatever's on this island—ghost, madman, Silas Grant risen from the grave—it's not your problem. You came to study erosion. You found something dangerous instead. Smart thing is to pack up and go."

"We're scientists," Brian protested. "We can't just ignore—"

"You're not equipped for this," Frank interrupted. "This is police business. Coast Guard business. Leave it to them."

Kate surprised everyone by agreeing. "Frank's right. We've done our due diligence. We've documented everything, collected evidence, even had direct contact. Now we hand it over to authorities and get off this rock."

Claire looked at the lighthouse, its beam just beginning to activate as dusk approached. Somewhere on this island, a man was preparing for his nightly vigil. Reciting coordinates to ships that weren't there. Maintaining a watch that served no purpose except in his own mind.

"Two more days," she said. "We stay two more days. We set up observation, document his patterns, get clear photographic evidence. Then we leave and turn everything over to the Coast Guard."

"Why two more days?" Frank asked. "Why not leave now?"

"Because if we leave now, the mystery continues. The authorities search, maybe find him, maybe don't. But if we stay, if we document him properly, we can provide concrete evidence of who he is, what he's doing, how long he's been here. We can give them everything they need to handle this correctly."

It was a rationalization and everyone knew it. Claire wasn't staying for the authorities. She was staying because she needed to know. Needed to understand how a dead man could keep a lighthouse.

Frank sighed. "Two days. I'll stay with you. But we do this smart. We don't confront him. We don't engage. We observe and document. Agreed?"

"Agreed," Claire said.

They moved operations to Frank's boat, anchored offshore. Safer than the cottage, easier to defend. They set up a rotation: two people on the island observing, documenting, while three remained on the boat ready to provide support.

That night, Claire and Brian took the first watch. They positioned themselves on the high ground overlooking the lighthouse, equipped with Allison's camera, Brian's notebook, flashlights, and the satellite phone.

As darkness fell, the lighthouse beam began its rotation. Fifteen seconds of light. Fifteen seconds of dark.

And then, at nine PM, he appeared.

The figure emerged from the rocks near the eastern cave entrance. Even at a distance, even in darkness between beacon sweeps, Claire could see his gaunt frame, his deliberate movements. He walked to the lighthouse base, placed his hand on the stone, and stood there for a full minute.

Then he began his circuit. Walking slowly around the island perimeter, stopping at intervals to look out at the dark ocean. At each stop, he spoke—Claire couldn't hear the words from this distance, but she saw his lips moving, his head tilting as if listening to responses only he could hear.

"He's checking positions," Brian whispered. "Like a sentry. Making rounds."

The figure completed his circuit and climbed to the lighthouse entrance. He disappeared inside. Minutes later, Claire saw movement in the lamp room at the top—sixty-five feet up, a shadow moving behind the glass as the beacon rotated.

"He's inside the lighthouse," she said. "Checking the mechanism."

"It's automated," Brian said. "There's nothing to check."

"He doesn't know that. Or doesn't care. He's performing the keeper's duty."

They watched for two hours. The figure descended from the lighthouse, walked to the cliff edge overlooking the western rocks, and sat. Just sat, staring out at darkness and fog, visible only when the beacon swept past.

At eleven PM, he stood, walked to the lighthouse base, touched the stone again—a gesture that looked almost like a caress—and vanished back into the rocks.

Claire and Brian returned to the boat. "He has a routine," Claire reported. "Nine PM, he emerges. Checks the perimeter, checks the lighthouse mechanism, maintains watch until eleven. Then back to the caves."

"Like clockwork," Frank said. "Like a keeper's schedule."

"Exactly like a keeper's schedule," Brian added. "I read Silas's logs. He documented his night routine. This matches it perfectly."

The next day, they observed in shifts. Different times, different positions. The figure appeared three times: dawn, midday, and evening. Each time performing the same ritual. Walking the perimeter. Touching the lighthouse. Maintaining watch over empty waters.

Allison got photographs. Dozens of them, from various distances and angles. When developed, they showed the same gaunt figure, always partially obscured by fog or darkness or distance. Never clear enough for definitive identification. But clear enough to see he was real, human, elderly but still strong.

"Tomorrow," Claire decided. "Tomorrow we try to talk to him. Direct communication. We explain we're leaving, that we mean no harm to the lighthouse. See if we can get him to reveal who he is."

"And if he won't talk?" Kate asked.

"Then we leave with the mystery unsolved," Claire admitted. "But at least we tried."

That night, Claire couldn't sleep. She lay in her bunk aboard Frank's boat, listening to waves against the hull, thinking about obsession and purpose and the fine line between dedication and madness.

What drove a man to spend fourteen years on a barren rock, maintaining a watch no one asked for, protecting something that needed no protection? Was it madness? Or was it the purest form of purpose—to serve something greater than yourself, regardless of recognition or reward?

And if Silas Grant had died—truly died—in 1967, who had taken up his burden? Who had looked at a dead man's obsession and said, *Yes, this is worth continuing. This is worth my life.*

Tomorrow they would try to find out.

Tomorrow, ghost or madman, they would seek the truth.
