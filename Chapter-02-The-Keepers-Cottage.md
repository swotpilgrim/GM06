# Chapter 2: The Keeper's Cottage

The cottage smelled like abandonment—mildew and old wood, salt air and neglect. The kind of smell that came from years of disuse.

Claire pushed the front door wider, letting the last daylight spill across warped floorboards. "All right. Let's see what we're working with."

The front room was stripped nearly bare: an iron bedstead with no mattress, a broken chair, shelving units covered in dust thick enough to write in.

"Cozy," Kate said, running her finger along a shelf. "When was this place last occupied? 1966?"

"That's when they automated the lighthouse," Brian said, cassette recorder already out. "Keeper's cottage would have been sealed up then. Fifteen years ago."

Fifteen years. Claire tried to imagine this place with life in it—a keeper tending the light, cooking meals, sleeping while the beacon swept the darkness. Now it was just bones.

"I'll take the kitchen," Kate announced, moving toward the back. "See if anything works."

Claire nodded. "Allison, check upstairs. I'll inventory down here. Brian, you're on—Brian?"

But the graduate student had already disappeared down the hallway, flashlight beam dancing across walls. Claire sighed and let him go.

The layout was simple: sitting room, kitchen, two bedrooms, bathroom. Everything stripped to basics. Wood panel walls dark with age, windows with grey-stained curtains.

Claire moved through methodically, making notes. Water damage in the northwest corner—roof leak. Floorboards warped but solid. The kitchen's wood stove looked functional, cast iron and heavy.

She was examining the stove's flue when Kate's voice cut through the quiet.

"Claire. You need to see this."

The tone made Claire's stomach drop. Not panic, not quite. But something cold and precise in Kate's voice, the way she'd probably sounded reporting problems on her Navy ship. Claire set down her notepad and headed for the kitchen.

Kate stood in front of the pantry, its door hanging open. Even from across the room, Claire could see the shelves weren't empty.

"Someone's been shopping," Kate said.

The pantry held maybe a dozen items. Canned goods, mostly—beans, soup, vegetables. A jar of instant coffee. And sitting on the middle shelf, wrapped in wax paper, a partial loaf of bread.

Claire reached past Kate and picked up the bread. It was still soft. Not fresh from a bakery, but not stale. Maybe three or four days old. She unwrapped it carefully, examined the bread itself—white, commercial, the kind you'd buy at any grocery store in Maine.

"Check the cans," she said quietly.

Kate was already on it, turning over labels to read dates. "Soup, purchased this year. Beans, same. Coffee—" She paused, holding up the jar. "Purchase date stamp says September '81. Two months ago."

They stared at the pantry's contents in silence. Outside, the lighthouse beam swept past the kitchen window. Fifteen seconds of light, then darkness.

"Coast Guard," Claire said finally. "Has to be. Maintenance crews, maybe. They use the cottage when they're working on the lighthouse."

"Maybe." Kate didn't sound convinced. She set the coffee jar down and moved deeper into the kitchen, checking cupboards. "But why leave food? And why not more? This isn't a full stock, it's... personal. A few things someone's eating."

"Eating?"

"Present tense." Kate opened the ancient refrigerator—unplugged, thank God, or the smell would have been unbearable. Empty except for a film of mildew. She closed it and turned to the counter, where a coffee pot sat next to the sink. Kate lifted it, looked inside, sniffed. "Residue's still damp. Someone made coffee in this pot within the last day or two."

The lighthouse beam swept past again. The kitchen went dark, then light, then dark.

"Show me the bedrooms," Claire said.

The first bedroom held nothing—just the iron bedstead and dust. But the second one made Kate's discovery look tame.

The bed had sheets. Not clean sheets, not fresh, but recently used. The pillow showed the clear indentation of a head, the sheets wrinkled and pushed aside as if someone had gotten up that morning. A wool blanket lay folded at the foot of the bed. And when Claire leaned close, she could smell it: human occupation. Sweat, skin, the particular funk of a body that had slept here.

"What the hell," Kate breathed.

Claire touched the pillow, pressed down. Still held the shape. "Within twenty-four hours," she said. "Had to be."

They stood in the small bedroom, staring at evidence that shouldn't exist. This cottage had been empty for fifteen years. Locked up, abandoned, automated away. But someone had been sleeping here. Recently. Regularly, from the look of it.

"Coast Guard doesn't make sense anymore," Kate said. "They'd stay on their boat or use their own quarters. They wouldn't sleep in a fifteen-year-old bedsheet that smells like—" She stopped.

"Like what?"

"Like nobody's washed it in months."

The lighthouse beam cut through the bedroom window. Light. Dark. Light. Dark.

"We need to get the others," Claire said.

They found Brian on the second floor, sitting cross-legged in what must have been the keeper's office. Documents surrounded him—old logbooks, maintenance records, official Coast Guard correspondence. His cassette recorder sat running, red light glowing.

"This is amazing," he said without looking up. "Logs going back to 1945, complete maintenance records, even personal notes from the keepers. There were four keepers between '45 and automation. The last one, Silas Grant, his handwriting is—"

"Brian." Claire's voice cut through his enthusiasm. "We found something downstairs."

Allison came down from the attic as they gathered in the kitchen. She'd been quiet during their exploration, camera around her neck but not shooting much. Now she stood in the doorway, arms wrapped around herself, while Claire and Kate explained what they'd found.

The bread. The coffee. The bed.

"Someone's been living here," Kate concluded. "Not visiting. Living. Eating, sleeping, making coffee. Within the past day or two."

Brian pushed his glasses up his nose, a nervous habit Claire had already noticed. "But who? The lighthouse is automated. There's no staff, no maintenance schedule. Frank would have mentioned if—"

"Frank didn't know," Allison said quietly. "Or he would have said something."

"So who?" Brian asked again.

No one had an answer.

Claire looked around the kitchen, seeing it differently now. Not abandoned. Occupied. By someone who'd been here when Frank's boat approached, who might have watched them unload their equipment, who might be watching them now.

"We need to search the island," Kate said. "Full sweep. If someone's here, we'll find them."

"In the dark?" Claire shook her head. "And what if we do find them? We're not law enforcement. We don't have weapons or any kind of—"

"I've got a wrench," Kate said flatly. "And I did four years of basic training. I can handle myself."

"I'm not worried about you." Claire rubbed her temples. "Look, whoever this is, they haven't hurt us. Maybe they're just... I don't know, homeless? Using the island because no one comes here?"

"Squatter," Brian offered. "It happens. Historic sites, abandoned buildings."

"Fine. So we find them, we explain the situation, we ask them to leave." Claire tried to sound confident. "We have permission to be here. They don't."

Kate didn't look satisfied, but she nodded. "Tomorrow, first light. Full search."

"Agreed." Claire turned to Allison, who'd been uncharacteristically silent. "You okay?"

"I took exterior shots," Allison said. "The whole time I felt like someone was watching me. Kept turning around, checking. Never saw anyone."

The lighthouse beam swept past.

"It's the isolation," Brian said. "Frank said it gets in your head—"

A sound cut him off. Footsteps on gravel outside.

They froze. The footsteps continued—unhurried, deliberate—then stopped.

Kate grabbed her flashlight and headed for the door. Claire caught her arm. "We go together."

They gathered at the door, four researchers huddled together. Kate and Claire had flashlights. Brian clutched his recorder. Allison raised her camera.

Kate opened the door.

The path stretched empty. Fog had thickened, reducing visibility to twenty feet. The lighthouse beam swept overhead, turning fog luminous before darkness returned.

"Hello?" Claire called. "Is someone there?"

No answer. Just wind, waves, the distant foghorn.

They stepped out, flashlight beams crossing the area. Gravel, grass, the equipment shed. Nothing moving.

"I heard it," Kate said. "We all heard it."

"I know." Claire swept her light toward the lighthouse, but fog swallowed the beam.

"Those were footsteps," Kate said.

They were. Footsteps on gravel, right outside. But whoever made them was gone now.

Or hiding.

"Inside," Claire said. "Now."

They retreated to the cottage. Kate checked the door locks—broken, barely functional. The windows latched but wouldn't stop anyone determined. They dragged the heavy iron bedstead from the front room and wedged it against the door. It wouldn't keep out someone who really wanted in, but it would make noise. That was something.

"We need to set up watches," Kate said. "Rotating shifts. Someone awake at all times."

Claire wanted to argue, but she looked at the fresh bread, thought about the slept-in bed, and nodded. "Two-hour shifts. I'll take first watch."

"Second," Kate said.

Brian and Allison split the rest. They set up in the kitchen where windows showed both the path and the lighthouse. Claire settled in with her flashlight and instant coffee while the others tried to sleep.

The cottage creaked. Old wood settling, wind in the walls, waves against rock. The lighthouse beam swept past every fifteen seconds, painting everything in stark white before darkness fell.

Claire thought about Frank's warning. *Island gets in your head if you let it.*

There was a rational explanation. Squatter, drifter, maybe someone who'd worked here before. They'd find them tomorrow.

She almost believed it.

At midnight, the foghorn sounded—three long blasts instead of its normal rhythm. Kate appeared from the bedroom within seconds.

"That's not normal," she said.

"It's automated," Claire said. But even as she spoke, she knew it was wrong. The foghorn had been sounding on a regular schedule all evening. This was different. Deliberate.

Three long blasts. The old maritime distress signal.

Outside in the fog, someone who knew the old ways was sending them a message.

They were not alone on Whitmore Point. And whoever shared the island with them knew they were here.
