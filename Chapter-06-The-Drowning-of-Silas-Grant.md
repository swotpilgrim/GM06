# Chapter 6: The Drowning of Silas Grant

Brian couldn't sleep. At four AM he gave up and returned to the keeper's office upstairs. Twenty-one years of Silas Grant's life waited in logs and files.

He started with the end. September 1966, maintenance log, handwriting still neat: "Light mechanisms functioning properly."

October 1966, early entries: "Light steady. Coast Guard inspection scheduled."

Then mid-October, the handwriting changed. Pressure heavier.

"Inspection today. They want automation. Told them she needs a keeper. They don't understand. The light is not machinery. The light is purpose. The light is life."

Three days later: "Termination notice. October 31st, final day. They're killing her. After twenty-one years. Machines aren't enough. Will never be enough."

Final entry, October 30th: "Tomorrow they take me away. Tomorrow the light goes dark. She needs me. Who will keep her when I'm gone?"

No entry for October 31st. Silas had been removed and the lighthouse automated.

Other documents: reports, clippings, a file marked "S. Grant - Post-Termination."

Coast Guard report, November 2nd, 1966: "Former keeper observed on mainland, exhibiting mental distress. Refused assistance."

Police report, November 15th: "Individual sleeping rough near marina. Silas Grant, age 60, confused, speaking about 'returning to duty' and 'the light waiting.' Referred to social services."

Multiple sightings through winter 1966-67. Silas living homeless, deteriorating, talking about the lighthouse. Brian felt sick reading it. A man whose identity had been stripped away.

Then, the final document: Newspaper clipping, The Boothbay Harbor Register, November 20th, 1967.

**Former Lighthouse Keeper Dies in Storm**

**Silas Grant, 61, Drowns Attempting Return to Whitmore Point**

*The body of Silas Grant, former keeper of Whitmore Point Lighthouse, was recovered yesterday from waters off the island where he served for 21 years. Grant had been living rough in the Boothbay Harbor area since his termination in October 1966.*

*Witnesses report Grant took a small boat from the marina during storm warnings on the night of November 17th. Coast Guard was alerted but unable to locate him in deteriorating conditions. His capsized boat was found near Whitmore Point the following morning. Grant's body was recovered three days later, identified through personal effects and dental records.*

*"He never stopped talking about going back," said Frank Garrison, a local fisherman who knew Grant. "Kept saying the lighthouse needed him, that ships would crash without him keeping watch. We tried to help, but he was too far gone."*

*Grant is survived by no immediate family. Funeral services will be held November 23rd at Coastal Baptist Church. Burial at Evergreen Cemetery, Boothbay Harbor.*

Frank Garrison. Frank had known Silas. A photograph showed the funeral—Frank in the back row, unmistakable.

November 1967. Fourteen years ago. Silas Grant was officially, legally dead.

So who was on this island?

Claire appeared, exhausted. "Find something?"

He showed her everything. She read in silence.

"Frank was there," she said. "At the funeral. Saw the body."

"Yeah."

"So either that wasn't Silas they buried, or whoever's out there isn't him." She paused. "Someone else with the same delusion?"

"Or someone who knew Silas. Learned from him. Internalized his obsession."

"That's still a living person. Someone we can talk to."

Brian wasn't so sure.

Kate appeared in the doorway. "You two need to see this. Now."

They followed her outside. Dawn had broken fully, grey light revealing the island in sharp detail. Kate led them to the lighthouse base.

Fresh scratches in the granite, carved with something metal. Words, painstakingly etched into stone:

*KEPT THE LIGHT 1945-1966*

*STILL KEEP THE LIGHT 1967-*

The second date trailed off, unfinished. A dash implying continuation. Ongoing. Forever.

"He did this last night," Kate said. "While we were inside. While Claire was hearing him recite coordinates. He was here, carving his memorial."

"It's Silas's service record," Brian said. "1945 to 1966, that's his tenure as keeper."

"But 1967 is when he died," Claire said.

"Or when he came back," Allison whispered. She'd joined them, camera around her neck, already photographing the carved words. "That's what he believes. He drowned in 1967, and he came back. Started keeping the light again."

They stood in silence, staring at the stone memorial. Somewhere on this island, in caves or hidden spaces, a man lived who believed he was Silas Grant. Or who believed he'd taken up Silas's duty. Or who actually was—

No. Brian stopped that thought. Silas was dead. Bodies don't come back. Funerals aren't mistaken. Frank saw the corpse.

But belief was powerful. Delusion could be absolute. And fourteen years alone on a barren rock, keeping watch for ships, reciting coordinates, maintaining a vigil for a purpose that no longer existed—that could shape someone into something not quite human anymore.

"We're searching the caves today," Claire said. "Low tide in three hours. We find him, we end this."

Breakfast was coffee and granola bars, eaten standing. Brian couldn't stop thinking: fourteen years of someone living here. If not Silas, then who?

Kate examined maps, planning. "Low tide 10:47. Four hours before the water traps us. We go in pairs—Claire and I take northern caves, Brian and Allison take eastern. Find evidence, get out, regroup."

"What if we find him?" Brian asked.

"We talk. Explain we have permission. Tell him to leave." Kate didn't sound convinced it would work.

At 10:30, they gathered gear. Flashlights, cameras. Kate brought her wrench. Claire had the flare gun. Brian carried a crowbar.

The tide was out, exposing the eastern shore's cave system. Dark openings between rocks, channels carved by centuries of water, spaces that flooded twice daily and drained like wounds.

"Four hours," Claire said, checking her watch. "We meet back here at 2:30 PM, no later. If anyone finds something significant, shout. Sound carries in the caves."

Brian and Allison headed for the eastern caves while Claire and Kate took the northern approach. The cave mouth was narrow, barely wide enough for Brian's shoulders. Inside, the smell hit him: salt, rot, something organic and wrong.

They clicked on flashlights. The cave opened into a larger chamber, walls slick with algae and barnacles. The floor was uneven granite, worn smooth by tides. Water dripped from the ceiling.

"Look," Allison said, pointing her light at the cave wall.

More scratches. Tally marks. Hundreds of them, carved into stone in groups of five. Brian counted quickly: over a thousand marks.

"Days," Allison whispered. "He's counting days. Years of them."

They moved deeper. The chamber branched into multiple passages. Some ended in walls of stone. Others curved deeper into darkness, sloping upward toward spaces that might remain dry even at high tide.

In an upper chamber: supplies. Old cans—beans from 1972, soup from 1969. Rusted fishing spear. Rotted blankets.

"Years," Brian said. "A decade at least."

"Since 1967," Allison whispered. "Living down here, emerging at low tide."

They documented everything. Then heard it: movement deeper in the cave. Scraping.

They froze.

"Hello?" Brian called out. His voice echoed in the stone. "We're not here to hurt you. We just want to talk."

No response. But the scraping continued, rhythmic and purposeful.

They edged forward, flashlights revealing another chamber. Larger. And occupied.

A figure sat in the darkness, back to them, hunched over something. Working. The scraping sound came from his hands—he was carving something into the cave wall.

"Sir?" Allison said softly. "We'd like to talk to you."

The figure went still. Then, slowly, he turned.

Brian's flashlight beam caught a face: gaunt, weathered, white beard matted with salt. Pale eyes that didn't quite focus. Hands gnarled and scarred. Wearing layers of rotted clothing, held together with wire and rope.

The man stared at them. Then he smiled, showing missing teeth.

"You came," he said. His voice was rough, unused. "She sent you. The light. She needs help. I knew she'd send someone."

Brian's skin crawled. "We're researchers. From the University of Maine. We have permission to—"

"Permission." The man laughed, a sound like breaking glass. "From who? The light gives permission. Only the light. And she gave it to me. 1945. Still have it. Always will."

"What's your name?" Allison asked.

The man looked at her like she'd asked a stupid question. "I'm the keeper. Always was. Always will be. Kept the light. Saved them. Kept the light. Saved them."

He stood. Brian realized how tall he was—over six feet, thin as a scarecrow but moving with surprising grace. He stepped toward them, and Brian raised the crowbar instinctively.

The man stopped. Looked at the weapon. Then at Brian's face. Recognition flickered in those pale eyes.

"You're afraid," he said. "Don't be. I protect. That's what keepers do. Protect ships. Protect the light. Protect..."

His voice trailed off. He swayed slightly, like he'd forgotten what he was saying.

"The light needs you to leave," he said finally. "You're measuring. Documenting. Planning to shut her down. I can't allow that. Won't. She needs me. I need her. We keep each other."

Then he moved, faster than Brian expected, lunging past them toward the cave entrance. Allison stumbled back. Brian swung the crowbar but hit only air. The figure was already gone, scrabbling through the narrow passage with the familiarity of someone who'd navigated it thousands of times.

They heard splashing. Running feet. Then nothing.

Brian and Allison stood in the empty chamber, breathing hard.

"That was him," Allison said.

"Yeah."

"He's real."

"Yeah."

"And he thinks he's Silas Grant."

Brian looked at the cave wall where the man had been carving. Fresh scratches in stone, still bright:

*THEY WANT TO KILL HER*

*I WON'T LET THEM*

They ran.
