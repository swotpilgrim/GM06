# Chapter 7: Sabotage and Entrapment

They ran back to the surface, scrambling through narrow passages, Brian's heart hammering against his ribs. Behind them, the cave system echoed with dripping water and their own panicked breathing. No pursuit. No footsteps. Just silence.

They emerged into grey daylight. Claire and Kate were already there, waiting by the cave entrance.

"We found him," Brian gasped. "In the eastern caves. He—"

"We know," Claire interrupted. "We heard you shouting. What happened?"

Brian and Allison explained between gulps of air: the supplies, the tally marks, the figure hunched in darkness. The gaunt face, the missing teeth, the pale eyes. The words he'd spoken: *I'm the keeper. Always was. Always will be.*

"He ran past us," Allison added. "Knew those caves like... like he's been living in them for years."

"Fourteen years," Kate said grimly. "At least."

They regrouped at the cottage, checking their gear, catching their breath. The encounter had shaken them all. Seeing him—actually seeing the figure who'd been stalking them—made it real in a way footprints and moved objects hadn't.

"So what now?" Brian asked. "We found him. We know he's here. We know he's delusional. What's our next move?"

Claire was already at the marine radio, trying to raise the Coast Guard. Static crackled through the speaker. She adjusted frequencies, repeated the call sign, waited. Nothing but white noise.

"The antenna," Kate said. She'd gone outside to check. "It's not just cut. It's gone. Completely removed. He took the whole assembly."

They stared at each other. Their communication was severed. No way to call for help, no way to request early pickup. Frank wouldn't return for four more days.

"We have the emergency beacon," Claire said, pulling the small orange device from their supplies. "Waterproof, battery-powered. We activate this, Coast Guard has to respond."

"How long?" Brian asked.

"Could be hours. Could be a day, depending on their patrol schedule and weather." Claire turned the beacon over in her hands. "It's our nuclear option. Once we activate it, we're declaring a legitimate emergency."

"This IS a legitimate emergency," Allison said quietly. "We're trapped on an island with someone who thinks we're trying to kill his lighthouse."

Kate checked the emergency dinghy—still holed, still unusable. She examined their supplies, taking inventory. "Food for three more days if we ration. Water for four. Generator's still down from when he drained it, but we can survive without power."

"What about him?" Brian asked. "What if he comes back? What if he—"

A crash from outside cut him off.

They grabbed their makeshift weapons and rushed out. The equipment shed's door hung open, padlock broken on the ground. Inside, chaos: their surveying equipment smashed, instruments torn apart, expensive tools destroyed with methodical precision.

But worse—the fuel drums were punctured, diesel spreading across the floor in dark puddles. The smell was overwhelming. Every drop of fuel they had for the generator, for heat, for any mechanical equipment—gone.

"He's eliminating our resources," Claire said, voice tight. "Systematically. Radio antenna, dinghy, now fuel and equipment."

"He's not just trying to scare us anymore," Kate said. "He's trying to make us helpless."

They searched the island again, this time looking not for the man but for more sabotage. They found it everywhere.

The cottage's propane tank: valve turned, gas venting into air. They'd lost half their cooking fuel before Kate shut it off.

Their water cistern: contaminated with salt water. Someone had poured seawater into the rainwater collection, making it undrinkable.

Food supplies: cans opened and spoiled, bread contaminated, only the sealed packages remaining intact.

With each discovery, Claire felt the trap tightening. They had limited food, no fuel, contaminated water, destroyed equipment, and no communication. Four days until Frank returned. If they could last that long.

"We need to fortify," Kate announced. "Turn the cottage into a fortress. He's had access to everything—that ends now."

They spent the afternoon securing their shelter. Nailed boards across windows. Reinforced the door with metal bracing from the destroyed equipment. Set up alarm systems using cans and wire. Created a safe room in the interior bathroom where they could retreat if necessary.

Brian organized their remaining supplies: three days of food if careful, bottled water they'd brought (thankfully untouched), first aid kit, flashlights, batteries. A survival inventory that looked frighteningly sparse.

As evening approached, they gathered in the fortified cottage. The atmosphere was tense, exhausted.

"We have options," Claire said, trying to sound authoritative. "One: activate the emergency beacon now, wait for Coast Guard rescue. Two: hold out for four days until Frank returns. Three: attempt to capture or restrain the man ourselves."

"Option three is insane," Brian said immediately.

"Is it?" Kate countered. "He's one guy. Malnourished, probably in his seventies if he really is Silas Grant, or whoever he is. We're four people. We could overpower him."

"And do what?" Allison asked. "Hold him prisoner? For four days?"

"Better than being held prisoner ourselves," Kate said. "Because that's what's happening. He's trapped us here just as surely as if he'd locked us in a cell."

Claire rubbed her temples, feeling a headache building. "The beacon is our safest option. But it also means abandoning the research, leaving the island, potentially never getting our work done."

"The research is already abandoned," Kate pointed out. "Look around. Our equipment is destroyed. Our supplies are sabotaged. Even if we wanted to work, we can't."

"So we activate the beacon," Brian said. "Call for rescue. End this."

Claire looked at the small orange device sitting on the table. It felt like admitting defeat. Her career, her reputation, her grant funding—all dependent on completing this research. If they called for emergency evacuation after three days, how would that look? The marine geologist who couldn't handle a week on an island?

But then she thought about the figure in the cave. The carved message: *THEY WANT TO KILL HER. I WON'T LET THEM.*

"Tomorrow morning," she decided. "We activate it tomorrow morning if the situation hasn't improved. Give ourselves one more night to see if he backs off now that we've had direct contact."

It was a compromise nobody liked. But they agreed.

They set up watches again: two people awake at all times, armed, ready. Claire and Kate took first shift while Brian and Allison tried to sleep.

The cottage felt different fortified. Safer, yes, but also more like a prison. Boarded windows blocked any view outside. The alarm systems made every small sound feel like an approaching threat. The lighthouse beam swept past, visible only through cracks in the boards.

At ten PM, they heard him.

Not footsteps this time. Scratching. Metal on wood, deliberate and rhythmic. Someone was carving something into the cottage's exterior wall.

Kate moved to investigate. Claire grabbed her arm. "Don't. That's what he wants. To draw us out, separate us."

The scratching continued for twenty minutes. Then stopped. Silence.

In the morning, they found the message carved into the wooden wall:

*LEAVE HER ALONE*

*LAST WARNING*

"That's a threat," Kate said. "Direct threat."

"It's also information," Claire replied. "He's still trying to drive us away rather than hurt us. If he wanted to kill us, he's had opportunities. Instead, he's escalating warnings."

"So far," Kate said darkly.

They made breakfast from their dwindling supplies. Granola bars and bottled water. No coffee—the propane was too precious to waste on luxuries.

Brian sat at the kitchen table with his historical documents, still trying to make sense of Silas Grant's story. "I keep thinking about the timeline," he said. "1967, Silas drowns trying to get back here. Body recovered, funeral held, buried in Boothbay Harbor. Frank saw it. Frank was there."

"We know," Claire said gently.

"But what if the body they found wasn't Silas? What if he faked his death somehow? Stole another corpse, planted his identification, made everyone think he'd drowned?"

"Why?" Allison asked.

"So he could stay here. So he could keep his vigil without authorities removing him again. Dead men can't be evicted." Brian gestured at his notes. "Think about it. A man obsessed enough to barricade himself in the lighthouse, to live rough after being fired, to try to row back during a storm—is that someone who'd just give up and die?"

"Or," Kate said, "someone obsessed enough to do all that would be exactly the type to genuinely drown in a storm because he refused to accept reality."

They couldn't know. Not without exhuming the grave, which was impossible from here.

What they did know: someone was on this island. Someone who'd been here for at least a decade. Someone who believed with absolute conviction that the lighthouse needed protecting. Someone who was now threatened by their presence.

And that someone had just given them a last warning.

Claire looked at the emergency beacon. Tomorrow morning, she'd promised. If things didn't improve.

But as she watched the lighthouse beam sweep past their fortified windows, she had a sinking feeling that things were going to get much worse before they got better.

Outside, in the rocks or the caves or the hidden spaces only he knew, the keeper waited. Watching. Planning. Protecting what he believed was his.

And inside the cottage, four researchers huddled together, counting down the hours until rescue or confrontation.

The island had become a cage. And they were locked in with something that was no longer entirely human—if it ever had been.
